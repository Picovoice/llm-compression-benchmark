Particle accelerators, such as the Large Hadron Collider in Europe, accelerate subatomic particles to great speeds. These particles move in opposite directions at nearly the speed of light and collide into one another to simulate conditions that were present as the universe formed. Which property of matter in the initial moments of the universe are these accelerators designed to simulate? (A) low density (B) high energy (C) massive nuclei (D) circular movement
Answer: B
