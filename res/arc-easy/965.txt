During cellular respiration glucose molecules undergo a series of reactions. This process results in the formation of up to 38 molecules of high-energy ATP per each molecule of glucose. Which is the source of the energy stored in these ATP molecules?  (A) kinetic energy generated by the chemical reactions (B) chemical energy originally stored in the glucose molecule (C) electric current created during the destruction of electrons in the glucose (D) potential energy from the difference in the concentration gradients of the cell
Answer: B
