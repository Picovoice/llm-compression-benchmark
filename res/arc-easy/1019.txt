The instructions below outline the procedure for a demonstration. Materials: four 100 g metal blocks, each of a different metal four polystyrene foam cups, each containing 150 g of 10째C water Procedure: 1. Place the four cups of water next to each other on the lab bench. 2. Heat each block to a temperature of 60째C. 3. Place each heated block in a separate cup of 10째C water. 4. Measure the temperature change in each cup of water after 100 s. At the end of the demonstration, which block raised the temperature of the 10째C water the greatest amount? (A) the block with the greatest density (B) the block with the lowest surface area (C) the block with the greatest specific heat (D) the block with the lowest thermal conductivity
Answer: C
