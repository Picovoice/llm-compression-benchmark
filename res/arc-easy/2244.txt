The conservation of matter can be demonstrated by using chemical equations. Which chemical equation demonstrates the conservation of matter? (A) 2Sn + 4HNO_{3} -> SnO_{2} + 4NO_{2} + H_{2}O (B) I_{2} + 5Cl_{2} + 6H_{2}O -> 2HIO_{3} + 10HCl (C) Cl + 4Na -> 4NaCl (D) 4P + 5HNO_{3} -> 5NO + 3H_{3}PO_{4}
Answer: B
