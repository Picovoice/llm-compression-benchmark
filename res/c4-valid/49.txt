Yeah they call me too, and continually do.I hate it. they call my job, they bother my family. Some man named Jason X(I kid you not this is what he said his name was) said I was to be in court at 11 am and then I would be hauled off to jail and spend the next year in a county jail for fraud. What a load of bull. They deserve more than the maximum punishment for this!
This sounds very familiar. I've been recieving calls from the same number 1-941-961-8518 for a few days now. They said the same thing that they were going to download the affidavit to the judge and that they had a court date set for me and I would be picked up the next day at 11am either at my house ( which they knew the address ) or at work. What type of aw agency, as they called it, would tell you what time that they would be at your house to arrest you? They would just come and do it. Haha Anyways they gave me the same number to call back as in some of the previous posts. 1-661-210-4683. I've reported them. But I am wondering if anyone else has had any other issues with them after they had let them know that they were in on their scam. I am just concerned since they do have ALL of my information.
I have to admit that I was rather amused by their response to me. These types of scams are very easy to recognize when they call. I told them that they were being inestigated and that extortion is illegal, after making sure they had been reported. Their reponse: "No, we can't stop. We want money"
I just received a call that told me to call this number. I know it's a scam, and I didn't answer but does anyone have a sense of how long they will continue to call? Since Thursday, they have called my home and work number at least twice per day each. Thanks!
What do you mean - tell me what to do? It was already posted that THIS IS A SCAM by Alfafa- did you even read it? The complaint process was in that posting If you are targeted by these criminals, be sure to report them to all the following federal and state law enforcement agencies (most of which you can do online or over the phone): 1. The U.S. Secret Service is responsible for protecting the country's financial infrastructure and payment systems from international and domestic threats. Call or write your local Secret Service field office to alert them to the details of this attempted extortion. The addresses and phone numbers for the local Secret Service field offices are listed at http://www.secretservice.gov/field_offices.shtml or in your phone book.2. Alert the FBI at https://tips.fbi.gov Be sure to tell the FBI that you are being targeted by extortionists over the phone. And if the crooks claim to be law enforcement or lawyers, officers of the court or bankers, be sure to include that information in your report.3. File a complaint with your local police. Most police departments will take a report over the phone. Be sure to tell them that you're being targeted by an extortionist and give them all the details.4. File a complaint your state's attorney general, the contact information for whom is at www.wvago.gov5. File a complaint online with The Federal Trade Commission at https://www.ftccomplaintassistant.gov/FTC_Wizard.aspx?Lang=enIf these crooks call back, promise them nothing, pay them nothing and tell them nothing other than that you know they're a scam and that you've reported them to law enforcement. (And be sure to report them to all the agencies above each time they call you.)By the way, here's just a small sample of numbers used by this particular group of scammers. Read the reports and you'll see the same pattern time and again -- phony organization names, thick foreign accents, and oddly worded threats that are so melodramatic and ridiculous that it's laughable:Fake Debt Collectors – Terrorizing Consumers http://abcnews.go.com/Business/story?id=5621205&page=1MORE ON FAKE DEBT COLLECTORS http://800notes.com/Phone.aspx/1-904-425-9141http://www.thepittsburghchannel.com/call4action/17285785/detail.htmlhttp://www.800helpfla.com/newsletter/2008/092008.htmlhttp://www.wvago.gov/internetloanscam.cfmAttorney General Darrell McGraw took the extraordinary step today of warning the public about a band of scam artists making threats to consumers who allegedly obtained Internet payday loans in West Virginia and across the nation. The consumers they threaten never obtained a loan at all or paid it off years ago.Internet payday loans are short-term loans or cash advances, usually for 14 days, made over the Internet via interactive web sites and secured by an agreement authorizing debits of the loan and all fees owed from the consumer’s checking account. These loans typically charge interest rates ranging from 600-800 APR and are unlawful in West Virginia. The scam artists, who speak English with a foreign accent, call themselves “U.S. National Bank,” “Federal Investigation Bureau,” “United Legal Processing” and numerous other phony names. They refuse to disclose real names and addresses and are believed to be operating “off the grid” from homes, automobiles, or from off shore locations or foreign countries, including India. Since the scammers have kept themselves purposely well hidden, thus far no law enforcement agencies have succeeded in locating or shutting them down.The scammers typically pose as law enforcement officers, investigators, lawyers, and bankers and threaten consumers that they will be arrested for “bank fraud” or other fictitious crimes unless money is wired immediately. They simultaneously scare and confuse consumers by using meaningless legalese gobbledygook phrases such as, “We are downloading warrants against you” or “We are filing an affidavit against you.” Consumers who don’t immediately fall for the scam are warned, “Only God can help you now.” The scammers almost always call consumers at work several times a day, and tell their supervisors, “Your employee has committed fraud and is about to be arrested.” Such threats have proven unsettling even to the most savvy consumers and employers who suspect the calls are fraudulent. Attorney General McGraw stated, “Ordinarily my office protects consumers from fraudulent activities by seeking injunctions in court. But legal action cannot be taken until the scam artists can be located. Even then, it is unlikely that the persons behind the fraudulent calls and extortionist threats would obey a court order. In this case, the consumer’s best defense is to be armed with the knowledge of the scam so that all demands for money can be resisted, despite the false but scarey threats of arrest.”McGraw added, “Because the fraudsters make a special point of calling consumers repeatedly at work, employers must understand that the consumers are innocent victims of a criminal enterprise and cannot stop the calls from coming. I also wish to assure the citizens of West Virginia that my office will continue to do everything possible to locate and shut down the outlaw debt collectors.” More information about this fraudulent debt collection scheme is available at the Attorney General’s website, www.wvago.gov/internetloanscam. Any consumers who have been threatened by these persons or wish to file a complaint about another consumer matter may do so by calling the Consumer Protection Hot Line, 1-800-368-8808, or by obtaining a complaint form from the Attorney General’s web site.It's a debt collection scam. And all their threats are false and illegal.This is a very active group of scammers, many of whom are calling from India (and probably other countries) and are in cahoots with a group of American pay day loan scammers. They attempt to extort money from consumers with a myriad of false and illegal threats, and alternately pose as debt collectors, federal and state law enforcement officers, lawyers and bankers. Their trademark is to use meaningless legalese gobblygook phrases like "We are downloading warrants against you" or "We are filing an affidavit against you." Another trademark phrase is to threaten the consumer with something like this ridiculous phrase: "If you don't pay then only God can help you."Typical of many financial scams of this variety, they usually demand payment via Western Union or MoneyGram or credit card. They use any number of phony names such as US National Bank, Federal Investigation Bureau, US Legal Investigation Bureau, Hopkins Law Office, United Legal Processing, Morgan Associates, United Pay Services, National Processing, White Collar Crime Unit and many more. These criminals also use many phone numbers from many area codes; they're probably using caller-id spoofing software and/or VoIP to disguise their real location.The main thing to remember is that anytime someone calls you demanding money to prevent your arrest, or demanding your lawyer's name so they can sue you, it is ALWAYS a scam. No debt collector (let alone criminals posing as debt collectors) has the authority to have anyone arrested for anything. (And it's illegal to them to threaten such a thing.) And since these foreign dirtbags routinely impersonate law enforcement, it's also important to remember that American law enforcement officers aren't in the business of debt collection. (Debt is a civil, not a criminal, matter.)The bottom line is, these are criminals trying to steal your money.A consumer posting a complaint about these same scammers at http://800notes.com/Phone.aspx/1-718-831-7157 notes that 718-831-7157 is associated with an India-based "outsourcing" telephone bank. Though a reverse search on WhitePages.com shows that 718-831-7157 is an unlisted land line in New York City, information on Debtbuyers.Com shows that that number is used by India-based Intellisourze. (Source: http://www.debtbuyers.com/debtbuyers.asp ) My guess is that it's a VoIP phone number.This is another piece of the puzzle that fits in perfectly with other information about this scam. There are some reports on 800Notes that have suggested that the crooks behind this offshore scam are also the crooks behind the notorious Bass/Ellis Crosby & Assoc./States Predisposition scams in Florida and Georgia. The interesting thing is that the number of complaints on here about the US National Bank/US Legal Investigation/Federal Investigation scam skyrocketed *after* April 7, 2008 when Florida obtained a $1.3 million judgment against Ted Ellis Crosby, shutdown his operations and barred him from ever conducting debt collections in Florida (Read http://myfloridalegal.com/newsrel.nsf/newsrel ... 5257424005858A6 ) There's certainly a good chance that the crooks placing these calls from India are doing so on behalf of the American crooks behind the Crosby/Bass/States Predisposition scams.Here's the contact information for the phone bank in India: IntellisOurzE BPO701, Sapphier, Nr.

The Better Business Bureau issued an alert today saying consumers across the country are getting phone calls from bogus debt collectors claiming default on a payday loan. Of course, the consumer needs to pay a large fee to avoid arrest -- as much as $1,000.The caller poses as a lawyer, and may threaten extradition to face trial if the consumer doesn't pay up immediately.What makes these calls alarming -- and perhaps convincing -- is that the perpetrators reference the consumer's personal information, such as the person's Social Security number, driver's license number, previous bank account numbers, home address -- even personal references."The amount of information they have is really troubling," says BBB spokeswoman Alison Southwick. She adds that the amount of data points to a possible security breach.Spread the word to your friends and family: Don't give out personal or financial information to an unknown caller. Scammers can spoof Caller ID to display different numbers, so trust your instincts over technology.The BBB offers these tips:• Ask the debt collector to provide official documentation which substantiates the debt. • Do not provide or confirm any bank account, credit card or other personal information over the phone until you have confirmed the legitimacy of the call. • File a complaint with the Federal Trade Commission online if the caller is abusive, uses threats or otherwise violates federal telemarketing laws or the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act. • File a complaint with the Better Business Bureau online if you believe a debt collector is trying to scam you.
Someone called from this number stating that he is downloading warrents for fraud and only God can help me now and good luck with this matter and he hopes I dont have any children around when I get arrested. He also sated that the police will come to my work to arrest me if needed. I could not understand anything this man had to say. He left this on my voicemail and I had to listen to it several serval times to understand him. I called the number back 1-661-210-4683 and it sends me to a fax. Please someone tell me what to do. I dont know who these people are.
A man called, sounded like he was from middle eastern, called me saying i owe 750.00$ that i had a fraud check...and it was a felony and i need to take care of it right now!!! He said i was gonnna get arrested tommorrow morning and taken to court if i never paid in the next 1hour....im really mad because they have a full system which is really shocking. He new where i lived, my cell number, and he also had the last 4numbers to my social security! I want to find out who this is, i wanna take them down!!!!
This same crap happened to me today also!! I hope they get what they deserve some day soon!!

My cell phone shows that I've received 3 calls from this number but the caller never leaves a message. Immediately after the call comes from this number, another one comes from (925) 965-2115. When I try returning the call, I get a busy signal. I'm going to check with my service provider to see if I can block calls from those two numbers. What kind of trash spends their time doing this stupid stuff?!! Don't they have better things to do with their time?
this number is a boggos kepp call me and i ask him were he get phone number, he said from my boyfriend and i said i'm married he hang up.
This number 480-225-2975 is on my phone in my voice mail folder and I can't get it out. Everytime I try it takes one minute of my time. It seems as if it is a phone number with a virus attached to it. Whoever did this is an ignorant pig and is uneducated-which is why they have time to do this kind of thing.
This number shows up in my nokia e71 as a number that I dialed??????
Same here the number called me and sat there for awhile on my vm then hung up.
I got a voice-mail on my cell from this number while I was in the mountains, out of range. Some guy who did give a first name but the voice mail got cut off. I couldn't tell why he was calling.
I got the untelligible message as well on my cell phone which I do not normally give out. No number left by caller, very strange.
I got a call from this number also. I couldn't make out anything also, it sounded as if there was water running in the background.
Yup - same here. An unintelligible message and even stranger, no ringing phone prior, but just the message.
Call from this number at noon today. Left a voicemail in unintelligible Spanish. Sounds like you need to quit calling people.
Hey, if you are still around (which I doubt) how do I get 'YOUR' number out of my phone?
This number is used for AT&T voice mail. That number would have been dialed by someone who wants to check your voice mail.
Whos number is this .I got a call from this number at 11:45 pm??????
I got call from this number this morning(Dec/29). Left nothing in my voice box.
they cakk severak times a day let it ring 2 then hang up..even late at night..
The call actually came from 206-397-1122 but 954 416 2730 is what shows up in the Caller ID (where the person or company name usually appears. When you call back 206-397-1122 you get the option to remove your number, but as several of the other commenters have noted, that 'unsubscribe' process could be just another element to the scam.
I Had the same experience. Two numbers showed up on caller ID. I NEVER, EVER answer these calls. My advice is that you NEVER answer them, either. I then check the number on Google to see who it is. I ALWAYS find that it is some telemarketer's number and that many other people have also been called. Again, DON'T ANSWER!!!! It'll only encourage more calls.
i rec'd this call tonight, with caller id, i did not answer......i did call back, blocking my number *67, and voicemail answered. I could not understand mans name or company of course....but i did enjoy calling him back all night leaving dog barking, soda slurping, tv noise, etc on his messages.....i learned this from another list of call numbers....i thought it was funny.....much satisfaction!
Agree with Linda: another number shows up WITH this number. that tells me that there are multiple line calls that are going to be linked to your numer, if you answer. Please consider that the reason there is no answer, is that this is an auto dial to verfy that YOUR number is a working number that will be answered. THEN YOU GET PLACED ON ANOTHER LIST. This call isn't meant to do anything but verify your number. Period. I saw this on 20/20 or 60 Minutes.
4:50pm, 30 APR 2012 received call recorded on caller ID as:Name: 954-416-2730Number: 206-397-1122Message from 'Rob Abrams' selling program to make $2000/week. "press 1" to connect to get full details. Did not identify company affiliation or provide 'call-back' number in message.
Received a call from these numbers, answered and received a robo-call from Maxwell Hughes. Hung up and checked the name on line. It comes back to Dr. Maxwell Hughes of Drexel University - an on-line school of some sort. Never did business with them and they are not a charity of political group so I am filing a complaint on the Federal Do-Not call site.
2 numbers came accross this 954-416-2730 and 206-397-1122. No person spoke, empty. what is this all about?
4:41pm, 01 DEC 2011 received call recorded on caller ID as:Name: 954-416-2730Number: 206-397-1122No message recorded on message machine.
never says anything--also has another number attached to it which is 206-397-1122 in Washington state.Undoubtedly another scam outfit.
I have been getting these phone calls also. I even have a voice mail with her saying " Little Bi*** I will have your phone company shut off you phone service for not paying the bill, you little bi***." I am waiting for a few more call and then I am filing charges on them and I have a voice mail with the number, date and time on it so she can't say she never called. Plus I have my phone records. I have tried to speak to a manager but he just told me to F off and kiss his A** because there is nothing I can do to stop the phone calls. I was told that they are the Gold rush internaional but that must be one of many names they use.
I got a call, I could hardly understand him. He told me to get infront of my computer. I asked which one because we have more than one. He said "Get to the computer, is it on? There are errors being downloaded and the IP address has been hacked." I again asked which computer and told him that he didn't understand that we had several. He said he was going to get his supervisor. Another guy came to the phone, same voice that I could barely understand. I said that I was infront of mine, which I was. He asked if it was on...ummm if you know all this information about my computer, shouldn't know whether or not it's on.He told me to press "R" and the "Windows" key to see the dangerous files. I told him that I have an anti-virus program constantly running and everything was fine. Again, he told me to press the keys, to which I said no.This prick told me that when my computer was scewed not to contact them with complaints and that he was also going to delete something on my computer. I told him he wasn't going to delete an effing thing, he went quiet but I could hear a bunch of telemarketer voices in the background. I yelled hello several times and he said "No, too late." and hung up.I tried calling back with my cell but the line was busy. They clearly didn't delete a thing or I wouldn't be able to send this message.This kind of bull needs to be stopped, I really wish there was something that could be done. They are going to contact someone who falls for their lies and really have problems.
They called here - pretending to be Windows microsoft. Saying that my computer will shut down, so please go to the computer - they want to hack into and take over your computer - so just hang up.They asked for mrs or ms so and so - I told them there is no one here by that name - they got silent and I could here the cars and motorcyles and busy street in the background. BEWARE - these people should really be reported to Police - I don't know if Police will do anything - but they should know about it.
Received a call from 519-663-0647 today, Sunday, at 4:45 pm. Was doing a survey on the state of the American elections. For doing the survey they were going to give me a paid vacation in the Bahamas. Gave me the option to proceed with the survey or decline. I declined. I called the number back a few times and it rang busy every time. I only answered it because the area code is local to where I live. I hate this s***. I have been on the "Do Not Call List" for 3 or 4 years and have checked to make sure every six months or so. This is b***s***.
people call from this number and don't say anything held on to phone but no one spoke. It shows that it might be from Horton Street in London Ontario between Boys and Girls place and street called Clarence.
It's a scam, this number called me to say that my computer was sending messages to them indicating it had a virus. I knew it was a scam but I played along. They were directing me to give them IP details from my computer... they thought I was using a PC so they kept instructing me to do things and telling me they could see what was happening (meanwhile I was doing nothing but sitting there playing along). Finally I told them, you are full of s***, I don't even have a PC I have a MAC, so I know you are lying. Don't ever call this number again. Their response "fffuuuuuccckkk you", and hung up. bunch of idiots. how do we crack down on these people so they don't take advantage of others? we are on the do-not-call registry, what else can we do?
14 Nov 2011Called me at work twice this week. The first time I picked the phone and the caller just hang up after I said hello. On the second call, I have recognized the number in the caller ID so I did not pick the phone. The person did not leave a voice mail. I will not answer a phone call from this number.
