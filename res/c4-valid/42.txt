This orange road jersey was worn by Primeau after his arrival to Philadelphia on 1/23/2000. The interesting thing about this jersey is the absence of the 2000 patch that was worn by the all of the teams in the NHL for the 99-00 season. Through some research/homework, I was able to uncover that not all of the jerseys in the Flyers first road set had the 2000 patches. This one may be an example of this as there appears to be no sign of the patch having been removed. It may have been one of the first jerseys worn by Primeau after his arrival to the team. Another possibility is that it was worn as a backup for the remainder of the 99-00 season and into the 00-01 pre-season. The LOA identifies the jersey as being worn in 2000-01 because there is no 2000 patch or evidence of removal but after speaking in length with Milt Byron the consensus is that it was worn primarily during the 99-00 season.
