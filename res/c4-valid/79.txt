There is skiing or snowshoe right outside the door, connecting to the Highlands Nordic trail system.

There is a fully equipped kitchen in each cottage. Larger cottages have 2 bathrooms.

This Year’s Photo Contest is ON!
Submit you best photo taken at a Trakkers Sunday Trip or Weekend Trip during the 2018–2019 season on our Facebook page following a specific theme to get the chance of winning a total of $50 in MEC gift cards.
The photo contest showcases members’ creativity while out of the trail, and inspires appreciation of cross-country skiing and winter outdoors. Each week’s winner of the photo contest is selected based on the most number of “likes” which their photo receives on the Trakkers Facebook page.
The first contest starts January 20 with the theme «Winter Sculpture »: take a picture of what you would consider a winter sculpture during your Trakkers trip and share it on the Trakkers Facebook page with a description. Interpret the theme as you wish and let your creativity soar! This contest will close on Saturday, January 26 at noon.
Find details about the contest on our Photo Contest page.
A reminder to everyone wanting to improve their skills, we now have Advanced Classic lessons for skiers who have mastered their intermediate skills and want to up their game, or who are thinking about teaching.
We also now offer Hills Lessons which focus on the skills required to master going up and coming down hills, with the level of instruction depending on the skill level of people who sign up.
Important: Ski lessons will now start 45 minutes post arrival at the resort. It would be really helpful for our instructors who are always concerned that no person is left behind if you would let them know if you are delayed for some reason beyond your control, such as being held up in a ski rental line up.
Information on assessing your skills, what you need to know to get started and about all of our lessons can be found at this link.
To everyone who makes all of these activities work, thank you! Happy sliding and snowshoeing one and all!

Well, it’s that time again! We are very excited for our first Sunday ski trip planned for this Sunday, December 16th to Highlands Nordic! Please register early for the bus, so we know you are planning to come. Advance registration always opens on Mondays and closes Thursdays at 9pm. Please review the Sunday Trips policy on the website to refresh your memory the procedures. If you wish to join a lesson, please sign up when you register for the trip. Please remember to check our website and facebook for regular updates on trip status, including any destination change. Better yet, follow us on facebook for the latest updates.
Speaking of lessons, Trakkers offers various types of lessons for skiers at all levels: Junior Trakkers (for kids), Beginners (both Absolute Beginners and Experienced Beginners); Intermediate; Advanced; Skating and Hills lessons (for new and experienced skiers).
Hesitant to make the leap or unsure of your technique? Try our new Advanced Lessons in both classic and skate technique, offered by Xavier Lambert and Sylvia Crowhurst, both CANSI certified level 2 instructors. These lessons are for skiers who have mastered their intermediate skill and want to up their game, or who are thinking about teaching. Students will receive on-snow video feedback throughout the lesson.
For more information about our lessons, go to this link on our website and keep your eye out for more updates to come.
If you’d like to share your skills with others, becoming a ski instructor is a great way to do it. This course will prepare you become an assistant ski instructor, and to pass the exams required to become a CANSI certified Level 1 instructor.
We had a great turn out at our Open House on November 16th, where we met many new people interested in the club. It was also wonderful to see many of our members. Thanks to everyone who came out, especially the many volunteers who helped with set up!
On November 18th a few Trakkers represented the club at MEC’s Annual Snowfest. Again, thanks to all who came out!
If you have a skill that might be of use in the running of a not for profit, entirely volunteer-run club, please speak to our bus captains or one of the board members on an upcoming trip about how you might be able to help. At the moment, we could use the help of a graphic designer to assist with updating some of our promotional display materials. If you have the skills and desire to help out, please let us know!
Ok, folks, the countdown is on! Conditions look promising and our Sunday Trips Coordinator, Liane MacGregor, is all over the weather reports. Here’s to shaking our snow globes between now and Sunday!

Do you feel it coming? As the last of the fall glory lights up our beautiful city, light snow is falling this morning. Yes, winter is on its way and our activities are ramping up!
On October 18th 22 Trakkers and friends enjoyed a great evening at our Winter’s Not Far Off pub night. It was really great to see everyone! Thanks to all who came out and thanks especially to Gina Ang for organizing the event.
Trakkers’ Open House is on Friday, November 16th,, from 7-9 p.m., at Swansea Town Hall – 95 Lavinia Avenue. Come to connect with your pals and meet some new folks exploring the club. Bring anyone interested in trying XC skiing. There will be refreshments and snacks. Learn about our plans for this year, including weekend and Sunday trips, ski lessons and more. Prizes will be awarded throughout the evening.
Calling all bus captains and anyone who would like to volunteer! Being a bus captain is rewarding and gives you an opportunity to participate in one of the most important parts of our club – making the Sunday trips work! You will get a free bus fare, as well as a reduced rate on several of the resort trail fees. It’s a great way to meet everyone in the club and have fun while you are volunteering. For anyone interested in volunteering, please contact Sam Tosaria at buscaptains@trakkers.ca.
Our annual Bus Captain Boot Camp will be held on December 8th from 1-4 p.m., at Swansea Town Hall, 95 Lavinia Avenue, in the Hague Room. This is a refresher for all returning bus captains and an introduction to this position for new volunteers.
On November 18th, from 11 a.m. – 4 p.m. we will be participating, once again, in Mountain Equipment Coop’s Snowfest. Come out, browse your favourite store and join us in getting excited about winter and, moreover, our club!
I would like to take this opportunity to encourage returning members to consider volunteering in our various activities. If you are interested, please contact me at president@trakkers.ca so we can talk about how you could get involved.
As the season ramps up, I would like to remind everyone, members and friends alike, that by participating in any Trakkers activity we agree to adhere to the Trakkers Code of Conduct, found on our website.

Summer may be ramping up slowly, but our off season cross-training opportunities are moving full steam ahead!
On May 29th we had a great hike through the Scottsdale Farm and area with Trakkers and new friends. Thanks Doug Seaborn and Florence de Lannoy for leading a great hike.
On June 9th another hike took us on our first of 3 hikes through the Dufferin Highlands, toward completing the Dufferin End-to- End – one full section of the Bruce Trail. Thanks to Anita Elash for leading us at a very solid pace! With everyone’s fitness rapidly improving it felt doable despite the terrain being hillier than on our first hike. Yes, that’s how quickly we find our legs, which we hope to keep moving until we can slide again!
Here you can see Doug keeping up his poling skills with ski poles and Trakkers and friends having a bite.
The Dufferin E2E hikes will continue on July 7th and August 11th, with details to be found on our website and further information to follow on Facebook.
Jim and Jannette’s bike ride offerings also continue with the 7th Anual Spokes and Spigots Niagara Winery Bike Tour on Sunday, July 15th. This is a guided bike tour with fellow Trakkers to wineries and a lavender farm near Niagara-on-the-Lake, with an optional supper at restaurant en route. This is a new route with new destinations not visited on previous tours. Further information can be found on our website and by following this link.
Jim and Jannette are also offering Sites and Cycles: the August Bike Tour, a guided bike tour encircling Hamilton and Burlington, with stops at historic sites such as the Hamilton Lift Bridge, the Beach Canal Lighthouse, H.M.C.S. Haida, and Dundurn Castle. Options also available include driving a Go Kart and a post-tour supper. Further information can be found on our website and by following this link.
