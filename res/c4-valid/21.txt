Welcome to the Austin Chinese Church English Congregation! ACC's mission is to make disciples of Jesus Christ by sharing His good news with all people, especially with those of Chinese descent, and helping them grow as followers of Christ, so that together we will bear witness of His glory in Austin, in the surrounding areas, and to the ends of the earth.
Thank you so much for taking time to visit our website! I’m Pastor Gaylord and I am thankful to be one of the Pastors here at Austin Chinese Church. We are a group of people of all ages who desire to grow in loving God and loving others, even though we are far from perfect. We gather together for worship, fellowship and learning, while growing together to reach out to those around us with the awesome message of Jesus Christ. He can literally change your life! It would be great to meet you and to share more of what God is doing in, and through, our church.
We invite you to join us on Sunday mornings to learn more about God, His love for you, and His purpose for us. English Congregation Service starts at 9:30AM every Sunday in the Ming Dao building. We welcome adults, college students and youth 6th grade and older to join us for this first hour of contemporary-style worship and Scripture teaching.
Don't know where to go when you arrive at Ming Dao? Look for one of our friendly greeters and ushers who will help you find a seat in our sanctuary. We also have a Connection Center in the lobby that you can visit after Sunday Service to meet some of the members of our church and get connected!
If you have kids, our Promiseland Children's Program and Nursery is available 9:30AM - 12:15PM for kids 5th grade and younger.
After Sunday Service, we continue to deepen our understanding of God and His relationship with us during our Discovery Groups, College Quest Class, and Youth Breakouts.
Promiseland, our Sunday Children's Ministry, is available during adult worship services. Parents can check-in their children who are 5th grade and younger for Promiseland in the Taylor Hall Lobby, where one of our Promiseland helpers will assist you. For more information about our nursery and children's programs, visit Get Involved.
Our education classes meet on Sundays after Sunday Service to equip people to grow spiritually by discovering the truth of God’s Scripture together over select relevant topics.
Adult Discovery Groups meet at the Ming Dao Building classrooms at 11:05AM. College students can attend Quest at the John Sung Building at 11AM. Youth who are in 6th – 12th grade are invited to attend Youth Breakouts in the Carey Building at 11AM.
We strive to be a church community that not only worships together on Sundays, but also shares life together so that we can help each other mature as followers of Jesus. To learn more about opportunities to grow with our church community beyond Sunday mornings, visit Get Involved.
We believe in the one and only true God, Creator of all universe, eternally existent in three persons: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.
We believe in Jesus Christ, the Only Begotten Son of God, Conceived of the Holy Spirit and born of the Virgin Mary. He suffered under the hand of Pontius Pilate, died on the cross, buried, descended into Hades and was raised bodily from the dead on the third day. He ascended to the right hand of the Father. He will return personally to judge the living and the dead.
We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Counselor, who convicts and regenerates the repentant sinners, and indwells, illuminates and empowers the believers to manifest their faith in action, attaining a sanctified life.
We believe the sixty-six books of the Holy Bible, both the Old and New Testaments, to be the inspired word of God, consistent in truth and inerrant, the divine and final authority for all Christian faith and life.
We believe that man was created in the image of God, had a glorious position originally, that he sinned and was depraved. As a sinner, man is in need of God’s grace for regeneration and can only be justified through faith in Jesus Christ alone.
We believe that there shall be a bodily resurrection of the just to eternal life, and of the unjust to eternal punishment.
We believe that the Church is built by Jesus Christ. The Church is His body, consisting of those regenerated by the Spirit of God and of which Jesus is the Head, and the purpose of the Church is to be Christ’s witness on earth.
Our church is governed according to by-laws that prescribe how the church is organized and administered. The by-laws have been approved by the Church Council and members, and are available for download.
