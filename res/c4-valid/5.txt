Don't panic! Alter Ego has changed its name to Ever Ego. A lot of Alter Ego products are still in stock, but when the suppliers order new stock, they will have the new Ever Ego label. CLICK HERE to see some examples.
IF YOU ASK ME WHAT I RECOMMEND for damaged, brittle, dry, overprocessed, dyed, or falling-out hair... (besides going to a Dominican hair salon)... no matter what kind of hair you have: curly, wavy, nappy, frizzy, straight, dry, oily; natural, processed, permed, relaxed, straightened, streaked, dyed... Here it is: the Italian Alter Ego line. Ask any Dominican stylist! This brand gets better customer reviews, more stars, and more praise from women of every race and age and type of hair than any other brand. It's legendary among Dominican women. It's the most popular hair-care brand on my site, and I use it myself. Of course there are other good brands but in my opinion you can't go wrong with this one.
The Alter Ego products described here are widely used in Dominican hair salons, both in the USA and in the Dominican Republic. They are famous for their effectiveness with our kind kind of hair... a mixture of African, Indigenous, and European; dyed or streaked, overprocessed, breaking, sometimes chemically straightened (which I don't recommend), and often falling out from stress or childbirth.

Alter Ego has dozens of product lines and hundreds — maybe thousands! — of products, but in this page I concentrate on the ones that are known and loved in Dominican hair salons for treating hair that has been damaged by chemical treatments or dyes, hair that is falling out or won't grow, and other types of hair problems like split ends, breakage, and frizzies. Here is a summary table of the products presented on this page; Ratings (stars) are as of April 12, 2019.
This is the flagship of the Alter Ego line, at least among Dominican women. It's a conditioner specially formulated for bleached, dyed, or straightened hair. Although it is based on garlic it DOES NOT smell like garlic. It's available at Amazon.com in many sizes under many names, such as "Hot Oil Treatment", "Garlic Mask", "Ego Conditioning Treatment", and with different garlic images on the label, but they are all essentially the same; CLICK HERE for more info and HERE to see more choices (bearing in mind that Amazon searches always show you a lot of extra items that you're not looking for).
1000ml (one liter). Especially for hair that has been chemically coloured, bleached, straightened and permed. CLICK HERE for more information and HERE for more choices (bearing in mind that Amazon searches always show you a lot of extra things).
Alter Ego's original anti-hair-loss shampoo, discontinued in 2013 and brought back by popular demand in 2016. To be used in conjunction with Alter Ego's anti-hair-loss drops, such as the neQual Intensive Engergizing Lotion, which is applied as a leave-in after shampooing and conditioning. Note that this shampoo had a 4½-star rating a few years ago, but those reviews disappeared.
1000ml. This is a coconut-based mask (conditioner) that concentrates on nourishing and moisturizing; ideal for dry and treated hair, but you don't need dry hair to use it; everybody loves it, it smells SO GOOD; CLICK HERE for more information, and be sure to read the reviews.
Liquid to stop hair loss and promote hair growth in a 125ml dropper bottle. To be applied after shampooing with the neQual shampoo (and, for those who use conditioner, the Garlic Treatment). Apply after drying hair and leave in. SEE BELOW for information about other Alter Ego lotions.
A special version of the neQual lotion just for women, in 12 individual applications to prevent hair loss.
* Bear in mind, Amazon searches are not precise; they show you a lot of things you don't want to see, and they don't show you everything you do want to see. But on the positive side, they won't show you any items that can't be ordered.
Alter Ego's garlic conditioners have been a top-selling in product at Aleida.net since 2010! They come in various sizes and packaging.
This section presents the original version, which can still be ordered while supplies last. Newer formulations and packaging are shown just below.
The Garlic Mask plus Vitamin A is a new formulation of Alter Ego's super-popular original Impac Ego Conditioner with Garlic, just above, and it is used the same way. INGREDIENTS: Aqua (Water), Cetearyl Alcohol, Cetrimonium Chloride, Dipalmytoylethyl Hydroxyethylmonium Methosulfate, Parfum (Fragrance), Methoxy PEG/PPG-7/3Aminopropyl Dimethicone, Limonine, Benzyl Alcohol, Propylene Glycol, Linalool, Amyl Cinnamal, Citric Acid, Triticum Vulgare Sprout (Wheat) Extract, C.I. 19140 (FD&C Yellow 5), Methochloroisothiazolinone, C.I. 14700 (FD&C Red 4), Methylisothiazolinone, Allium Sativum (Garlic) Bulb Extract, Cochlearia Armoracia (Horse Radish) Root Extract, Ferula Assa Foetida Root Extract, C.I. 42090 (FD&C Blue 1).
Like the Impac Ego treatment shown above, this product might have “hot oil” in its Amazon.com product name even though the product itself doesn't say "hot oil" anywhere. You don't heat it, just use it like any other conditioner.
The Garlic Mask with Vitamin A. This is the 1000mg (33.8 ounce) size of the Garlic Mask described just above. It's also available with a pump dispenser (next item).
As of this writing the Amazon title for this item is “Alter Ego Garlic Mask Hot Oil Treatment with Garlic”, but again, there is nothing about hot oil on the packaging.
The same Alter Ego Garlic Mask, but with a pump dispenser! Good news because it keeps water and germs out of the conditioner when you use it in the shower so it won't get diluted, contaminated, or moldy. All conditioners should have a pump like this! (In the salon, many Dominican stylists use a spatula or a sterile tongue depressor to take conditioner from the jar.) Some assembly required (for hints, see this page).

Labeled in English, Spanish, Italian, French, Portuguese, and German.
This is one of my all-time favorite hair products! It smells soooo good and makes my hair so soft and smooth and bright and fragrant.
Alter Ego Coconut Conditioning Mask: “Nourishing, moisturizing and conditioning mask. Non-greasy, does not leave hair heavy. It provides a silky and soft look. Ideal for dry and treated hair.” DIRECTIONS: Wash hair and towel dry. Apply mask to scalp evenly, then to hair shaft and ends. Leave on a few minutes, then rinse well.

The new Ever Ego coconut products are packaged in a brighter color.
In these stressful times, hair loss among women is a “growing” problem! Alter Ego specializes in products to stop and reverse hair loss. Even if you don't have a problem with falling hair, these products can help to keep your hair where it belongs year after year, looking better and more manageable too because they are also targeted at women with processed or damaged hair, split ends, frizzies, and most other problems.
This is the traditional Alter Ego anti-hair-loss shampoo that was discontinued about 2013 because it contained sulfates such as Sodium Laureth Sulfate, which are detergents used to cut the oil and dirt in your hair and to produce suds. In recent years there has been a movement away from sulfates but now it turns out that some people prefer sulfates. Especially since the primary purpose of these shampoos is to stop hair loss.

The main difference is that Butyphenyl and Methypropional that were present in the original version of this product are not in the new version.
The Alter Ego “drops” (lotions) are are clear liquids that you massage into your scalp after shampooing, conditioning, and drying your hair, and left on (not rinsed out). In other words, they are like a liquid leave-in. All of them are designed to strengthen the hair bulb thus reducing hair loss, and also to stimulate hair growth. They come in 125ml (4.2oz) dropper bottles, and some of them also come in sets of single-application vials (ampoules, ampollas).
Honestly, it's impossible to find out what exactly the differences are among these lotions. Alter Ego does not provide explicit guidelines for which one is for which type of hair with which type of problem, but instead uses vague adjectives like revitalizing, invigorating, energizing, nourishing, regenerating, stimulating, restorative, purifying, restructurizing, and so on. The only specific information offered is that the neQual Energizing Lotion and Curativ Cren are for fine and weak hair, and the Herb Ego Fresca is for limp and damaged hair. Nevertheless the customer reviews for all of them say that they stop hair loss and breakage and promote hair growth. Obviously results can vary from person to person, but the best way to choose among them is read the reviews of each one to find the one with the best reviews from people who have hair like yours with problems like yours.
I went to a new Dominican hair stylist with my own supplies! ... Not forgetting my Alter Ego Energizing Intensive Hair Lotion for Hair Loss. I want to share with you that my hair is no longer shedding/ breaking at all!
...this product NeQual by Alter Ego does work. My Dominican hairdresser recommended it, I've seen her using it herself.... Since I've been using this product I've seen a huge difference I have so much hair growth now. I even bought one for my Mom.
My hair loss was so bad that I use to cry everytime I washed my hair or put my fingers through my dry hair... Since I started using this product, my excessive hair loss has practically stopped except for the strands that normally fall out when washing. I was buying this product from my hairdresser and it was expensive. Since I found it here at Amazon, I have been buying it here.
Alter Ego Energizing Lotion is available in a dropper bottle or in a set of 12 single-application 10ml vials (ampoules), and also paired with the Garlic Shampoo (for people who don't use conditioner).
The only words that describe this product are Miracle in a bottle. In just one month my hair has nearly doubled in length. I actually feel my hair growing. It's pricey, but it worth every penny. I use it twice a week.
I am an African American female who experienced a long drawn out illness. While recovering my hair started falling out by the handfuls... I purchased the shampoo, conditioner, hot oil garlic conditioner and the revitalizing lotion. I shampoo and condition my hair twice a week and use the revitilizing lotion everyday. After three weeks of usage twice a week I saw little to no hair falling out. These are remarkable products!!!

The Revitalizing Lotion and the Energizing Lotion are very similar, but the Energizing Lotion is especially formulated for fine hair, whereas the Revitalizing Lotion is for all types of hair. Both of them leave your scalp with a tingly feeling for a few minutes.
