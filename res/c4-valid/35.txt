12 Why Drop Ship Through GSR?
In case you don‚Äôt know, drop shipping is a way people can earn an income (part-time or full-time) by selling real products to real customers, and taking a profit, but without the risk and expense of having their own shop and buying stock in bulk.
Free drop-shipping training is also one of the benefits available when you open an account with my e-commerce business.
Suppose you decide you‚Äôd like to start a risk-free business‚Ä¶. there are suppliers who will let online retailers promote their goods and when a customer places an order with you, instead of taking the item out of YOUR stock and posting it on, you ask the supplier to fulfil the order and send it direct to your customer. So‚Ä¶.
You then have the chance to sell ten items for the same amount of work spent listing just one. And because the items are not in YOUR warehouse, NOT paid for before you sell them, there‚Äôs no rush to sell them.
Start your online business drop-shipping as fast or as slowly as you have time for. Simply set yourself a daily schedule and stick to it.
Will you list 10 of one item every day, or will you list 10 batches of TEN items every day?
You can see how, very quickly, you can build an ever-increasing ‚Äúvirtual shop‚Äù of products waiting to be sold, bringing you a risk-free profit.
You have to find suppliers who will offer you a good range of products AND look after you with reliable delivery systems. Depending on the type and number of products you want to sell, you may find yourself trying to negotiate with ten or more suppliers.
Suppose you have a ‚Äúlean sales month‚Äù ‚Äì how will you make your regular income?
Is drop-shipping starting to sound hard?
Negotiate terms ‚Äì possibly the most challenging‚Ä¶..
Before a supplier of good calibre is prepared to risk their good name with an unknown ‚Äúshop‚Äù they may, or may not, want to check out your previous experience and take references. You may need to be approved for drop-shipping.
Because there‚Äôs a certain amount of work for suppliers to do preparing sales material etc, unless you can show a proven track record, with many customers, they may negotiate tough terms, keeping your margins slim.
It‚Äôs a balance of ‚Äúwho needs who the most‚Äù?
A corner shop may jump at the chance of you promoting their products online, but Walmart (for instance) may not feel the need to be so accommodating to a one-man-band‚Äôs requests.
Imagine you had prior approval to access hundreds of suppliers, with over 2 million different products ready stocked for you to sell to your customers.
How many hours would you have saved in setting all that up?
Hundreds! So how much do you think that would be worth to you?
‚Ä¢ $200 a month would maybe cover the cost of an hour of one negotiator‚Äôs time?
‚Ä¢ Maybe $100 a month to reflect the increased profitability the negotiator has been able to for YOU as one of over a million potential drop-shippers?
What if I told you that all that is available to you FREE?
Here are some of the affiliate stores available to upgraded members!
UPDATE Feb 6th 2017: Alibaba and AliExpress are new affiliate partners ‚Äì opening up a huge number of extra products.
What Can You Expect To Earn As A Drop Shipper?
That‚Äôs impossible to predict‚Ä¶. But here are some hypothetical figures.
Suppose in one week you listed 50 items each clearing you $10, that‚Äôs $500 if you sell them all.
Listing 5 different products (one per day) selling 10 of each is an achievable part-time goal when you know the most efficient way to do it.
Remember ‚Äì once they‚Äôre listed, you can just sell them over again.
On the down side, if you only listed one item and cleared $10 profit, you‚Äôre going to be pretty disappointed. See ‚ÄúRetail Is Unpredictable‚Äù below.
I don‚Äôt know which you will do, or what you will do ‚Äì so I can‚Äôt predict your drop-shopping income.
With ANY online business, rewards do not come without sales / purchases.
Retail Is Unpredictable ‚Äì What If I Have A Lean Month?
As we saw above, income from drop-shipping is unpredictable.
Or‚Ä¶ thinking more positively, what if you want a holiday from drop-shipping? To spend your profits!
We‚Äôve got you covered when you drop-ship with our company ‚Ä¶..
As a fall-back position, if you don‚Äôt make any drop-shipping sales of your own you can be your own customer ‚Äì making purchases of products you would have bought anyway.
The cost of my purchases is covered by my commissions, so I‚Äôm making a profit ‚Äì which means my products are effectively free.
Any month you want to make your own purchase ($50 or $100 ‚Äì depending on your rank) this qualify you for the company sales pools, but it‚Äôs NOT compulsory. Just as long as adequate sales are made in your stores you will qualify.
You‚Äôre probably aware that one of the challenges of running your own online business is keeping customers once you‚Äôve found them. The typical customer (including me) is more loyal to their wallet than to any regular supplier.
If you don‚Äôt retain a customer purchasing regularly, you need a method of replacing them with new ones, or your business will shrink.
To maintain a steady supply of purchases from each customer you can either use the usual customer incentive methods, like special offers, newsletters etc ‚Ä¶.
Or‚Ä¶. Simply give them their own free store, tell them to make purchases there and they‚Äôll get paid a share of the profits.
You‚Äôll still make a profit on their purchases, you just won‚Äôt make as much profit as when they were a direct customer. But you will have less involvement, freeing up your time for building your business or enjoying the fruits of your labour.
Your customer will have their own free store to purchase from, and maybe find new items.

Why Drop Ship Through GSR?
With 2 million products to choose from, there‚Äôs plenty of scope for everyone to be selling different products.
Because our drop-shippers are also benefitting from a share of the company‚Äôs profits, everyone profits from the company‚Äôs overall success, so everyone has a vested interest in co-operating, to boost global turnover.
You have nothing to lose other than a little time to register your free store and go through the free drop shipping course.
Drop shipping is something new I have learned from this amazing post. More importantly, thanks for sharing these pros and cons of it.
Glad to have helped you find the free drop shipping course. Being part-time online, I don‚Äôt actually drop-ship myself, so I pass referrals for drop-shipping to someone in my team.
Apparently some people earn enough for a full-time income from drop-shipping. Obviously that takes time and effort, but with the training and support in our groups, people are much better placed to be successful with it.
Once again I have found very informative post on your website. You always comes with incredible subject and those are very beneficial for people. Dropshipping is not a new term, it has been around for quite some time.
But there are also misconceptions on what drop shipping really is. Most people who are starting their first online business via auctions or online stores don‚Äôt have a lot of money to buy a bunch of products or the space to warehouse and store the products they want to sell online.
This is where working with a real Dropshipper will save you a ton of money. Eventually, thanks for sharing your valuable thought in deep regarding this subject.
I came across dropshipping a while ago, but only really took interest in it when it came to my attention as one of the ways that TPS affiliates can earn.
I‚Äôm told that some dropshipping courses can be expensive, but ours is free for members.
All the heavy lifting of dropshipping has already been done to people by the TPS corporate team.
Hi Joy, I‚Äôve started 2 drop ship sites. For one I decided to buy the products and sell myself. It‚Äôs early days yet but I‚Äôve learned a lot and they are easy to set up and run. I‚Äôm always keen to learn more and will take a look at the free training.
Hope it goes well for you and please feel free to add to your knowledge from our training.
I certainly haven‚Äôt given up on you üôÇ Your store is waiting when you‚Äôre ready. Hopefully you verified your ID, so your team will be accumulating.
I‚Äôve heard of TPS before and drop shipping seems to be a popular way of doing business. I have ever explored it myself for some reason.
TPS is becoming better known now ‚Äì especially after their link up with Alibaba.
Some people make a lot of money with drop shipping but it‚Äôs not something I have been involved with personally either. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm passing people on to my team mate Tony if they are interested.
Hey Joy! Thanks for sharing TPS with us, this looks like a great way to make some money here online..
Yes, people (included me) are earning nicely out of the commissions on products sold through TPS. As those who chose to take the drop-shipping route start to increase their sales, this will increase.
This is indeed informative post as I learned lot of new things about drop shipping. I think its really great business to learn good money.
I‚Äôm glad you learned about it. Please let me know if you are interested in taking it further.
