Category Archives: In His Eyes..
Sometimes it’s hard to think of ourselves as good; at times things just come out wrong.. harsh or self-serving.
I know for me, when I am feeling like I just can’t get it right, my solace and identity come from God, my hope and my redeemer….
Dear Heavenly Father, Good Morning… I do trust in You. I trust in You for my security, hope and goodness. Today, as I come before You, I am feeling like I have failed You, my heart feels heavy and my thoughts scattered.
Thank You that You are the God of my heart, and in You I am safe, secure and fully accepted… Thank You for Your great forgiveness that washes over me, freeing me from my own thoughts of condemnation… Thank You for seeing the good in my heart, and creating in me a steadfast spirit.
“Anger is cruel, and wrath is like a flood, but who can survive the destructiveness of jealousy?
Oh Lord, let me bow my knees to You, knowing and believing that You have a purpose for my life. That I don’t need to compare or analyze what You are doing in someone else’s life..
Your love is so great.. Your hope and beauty fill me with peace.
I came into your house. You did not give me any water for my feet, but she wet my feet with her tears and wiped them with her hair. You did not give me a kiss, but this woman, from the time I entered, has not stopped kissing my feet. You did not put oil on my head, but she has poured perfume on my feet.
Oh, Dear Lord, how I see myself in this beautiful woman… As I come before You this fresh new day, how I thank You.
I love Your love for this sweet woman. I thank You that I can come before You in my weaknesses, and know that I am safe in Your arms..
May my life be an offering filled with Your hope to those who are lost and hurting..
In my mind I would just imagine faith as believing.. pure and simple..
God also gives us these most amazing stories of what other’s faith looks like to give us hope.. and encourage our hearts to seek God in the midst of our life’s trials, confusions and fears. Let’s connect the dots of this sweet women’s journey, and see how she got from just being someone in the crowd, to being smack in Jesus sight.. then Hearing the most amazing wonderful words ever….
Dear, Heavenly Father, good morning and thank you for another new day! How amazing it is to know that you had us in mind when you orchestrated the Bible’s contents..
We are that loved by You.
Oh, Lord, will you please speak to my heart what faith looks like in my life…In my circumstance.
Let’s look at the facts….
She had a need. She spent all that she could to get help. She was exhausted. She heard about Jesus. She decided to seek after Him. She believed He would help her. She made a conscious effort to find Him, and then to reach out to Him.
Do you have a need? Have you spent all that you are able? Are you exhausted? Have you heard about Jesus? Do you believe He will help you? Have you made a conscious effort to seek Him, and have you, or are you, reaching out to Him?
So… what does faith look like to you?
Let’s together, as we are sitting here, write out our need. Does it match what you may have written down on Day 2, or has it changed to something you didn’t even know you needed?
For me I didn’t know why I felt so sad. That’s where my need began. When I pictured myself standing there; as Jesus was calling out, “Who touched me” I realized I needed Him. And just like this sweet woman, I started to realize that I needed to tell Him my whole story. While I had accepted Him as my Savior, and believed in doing so, I was forgiven of my sin. I needed to let his forgiveness, personally, heal my heart. That’s what a personal relationship is, right? It’s personal. It’s between me and God.
He wanted to know my story through my words.. Just as I was learning about Him through His word! To all of a sudden realize that God wants to hear the things that pained my heart, that He accepted me, and to know from the bottom of my heart, He knew all of me, was freedom!
Faith was trusting Him with my heart. Faith was trusting that He deeply cared about me. Faith was trusting that He wanted to be by my side. Faith was believing Him when He said, “Daughter” that I was, and am, just that; His daughter.
What does faith look like to you?
Dear Sweet, Heavenly Father, You are everything to me. Thank You for opening your word to us and making it come alive. I am over joyed to accept that I am your daughter, that You will continue to keep the pieces of my heart in your hands is such a gift. To be able to walk in Your peace, knowing that whatever I face you will be with me, and You will free me from my suffering is a treasure that I will hold ever so closely as I live one day at a time loving you, and loving others!
Have you ever been called out?
Good Morning, Dear Friend! Today we will be focusing on what it must have been like to be called out by Jesus.
And that is a blessing for sure!
Dear Heavenly Father, As I come before you today, please consume my heart and mind with your awesome presence… fill me with your love, hope and great wisdom. How I pray I will be changed… free to walk out of the shadows, and into Your beautiful light..
In this huge crowd of people, Jesus knew He was touched… He wanted to know her. He wanted her to tell Him why His power was released, and He wants to know you too! It was at that moment when, like a lighting rod hitting an antenna, In a moment’s flash, I knew Jesus saw me! He knew the exact moment what I reached out with my heart, and touched His clothing.. I was saved by His grace, and I had already begun living a new life, yet He knew I was holding on to pain, fear, and regret. He wanted me to trust Him with my whole truth..
I must have cried for an hour… letting down one wall at a time… confessing past failures, reliving things I didn’t want to ever relive, let alone remember! It was exhausting, cleansing and so good to be able to be completely vulnerable. Completely real..
For the first time in my whole life, I was able to be me… the real me!
Can You see that? Have you been able to let your walls down? Have you reached out to Jesus with your utmost fears, hopes, sadness or pain?
Falling at His feet, in fear and trembling she told Him the whole truth! The whole truth.. That must have taken her some time, right?
She sought Him. She didn’t know that He would answer her, let alone that He would heal her.
She needed Him, and He didn’t let her down. The focus isn’t on the healing, it’s on the beautiful truth that God is near. He stops when we cry out. He listens’ to our cries. He is the great I Am. That is our comfort, hope and strength. Not the outcome, but the presence of God.
As I am writing this, I am being reminded that that should be our posture. Always seeking His presence.. No agenda. No pressure for God to answer our cries with a certain outcome… because there is no peace in wanting anything… Our peace is in Jesus, under His wing, resting in His presence. Thank You, God, for reminding me of this… it is always needed.. always refreshing, and always my comfort!
I believe with all of my heart, every word of the Bible has importance. The fact that the scripture says… “she told Him the whole story” gives me relief. The whole story definitely took some time.. He let her finish. He beckoned her to speak, and she did!
She cried out in the presence of a huge crowd, she must have been dying!!! This shows me how much she needed Him, how much she trusted Him.
Do you trust Him even if the outcome of your cry doesn’t turn out the way you want, or think it should be?
This is the very reason it is a blessing to be called out! He isn’t wanting you to run away, and continue living your life without His full attention… He is beckoning you to tell Him your whole story, and then, sweet friend, trust His will and plan for your life.
No more controlling, No more pushing… Just living a life in His presence. One day at a time.
This is His will for our lives.
Dear Heavenly Father, thank you so much for calling us out.. for taking the time to stop, listen and heal this sweet woman. It is so amazing to be fully known and fully accepted just the way I am… in my heartache, desperation and fear… you have my heart in your hands, and I am learning to leave it there… trusting you with my life. With my hopes, dreams and joys… May your will be done. Thank you for showing me how to be beautiful in Your eyes… completely vulnerable, and completely free to trust whatever Your will is for my heart and life..
Thanking you God, for your beautiful mercy..
Dear Heavenly Father, I love You!
How I praise and need You.
As we come before you today, Lord, thank you for your cleansing power in our lives, and for your great forgiveness and hope. Please open our hearts and minds as we seek to give you more of our hearts, and live a life of beauty in Your eyes..
Can you imagine the moment Jesus stopped?
This image so takes me back every time. As, I put myself in this sweet woman’s place, I feel like, Him stopping, was the last thing she expected..
He not only stopped, He called her out!
The Bible says that Jesus was on His way to heal a dying girl. To me that is huge! I guess that’s why, in my heart, I am so struck by Him stopping. He must have been in a hurry. He had some place to be, and to me, someplace pretty important. He was on His way to heal a dying girl. Somewhere in the back of my head, I had heard someone say, and Maybe, you have too, that God has way more important things to do then deal with my problems. It’s funny how things we have “heard” about God can cause us to just expect the worst, right?!
Why did He stop? In the middle of that huge crowd, anyone could have touched Him!
And that surprised me more than I can express! I feel like the moment He stopped, she must have been scared to death! I thought, without a doubt, He was going to be mad.. I wonder if she thought that too? Shame, fear, rejection… felt so normal..
He was very aware of her pain, He knew the exact moment she reached out and touched Him, because the moment she touched Him..
How amazing is that? She reached out. He released His power… no explanation.. no reasoning!
What are you going through in your heart and life that may have you exhausted! You have reasoned, explained, rationalized all of the scenarios out in your head a million times?
Maybe you too are fearful, tired, and don’t know what to expect.
All she did was reach out..
All you have to do is reach out!
In our brokenness, in our pain, and uncertainty… He is on our side..
When Jesus stopped, He made a ginormous statement to all of those watching.
As I see it, He didn’t want her to just disappear. To think that maybe it was an accident that He healed her. He didn’t want her to question whether or not she deserved it. He didn’t want the crowd to be able to gossip later about her. He showed the disciples, yet again, He was there for people who needed Him, not those who think they can help themselves… who think they don’t need God.
Dear Father, How I thank you that I don’t have to do my life alone..I know I need You and I want You in every bit of my being..
Oh, Lord, I am a sinner, and I thank you for your beautiful mercy..
He most definitely didn’t want her to carry all of those feelings of fear, sadness… hopelessness, or regret any longer!
Today, bask in the truth that God sees You, loves you, adores you.. He is your Heavenly Father that protects, comforts and hides you under His wing.
Yes, we fail. Yes, we sin. Yes we (most of the time ) don’t know what we are doing..
This sweet, alone woman, certainly didn’t know what she was doing. She “selfishly” sought after him, even though she was thought to be “unclean”, and being around others could have jeopardized their relationship with God.. That didn’t stop her!
Take refuge in the fact that you matter to God. We have a God who stops to listen.
It is a beautiful truth that we can always, no matter what time, day or night, go to God..
People can’t be there for us 24 hours a day, people will let us down.. we are not perfect.
He is always near, and always fighting for our heart!
He could have kept going, He did not have to stop. He didn’t. And He doesn’t today!
Will you let God in?
Dear Heavenly Father, Wow! You amaze me every single day. Today I am struck by your kindness. That you are never too busy for me. You took the time to stop for this sweet woman, in the middle of a crowd, on Your way to heal a dying girl… Oh, Lord, you stopped and You listened, and You loved.
I give you my day, my heart and my life. How I ask you, Father, to help me to be in constant communication with you throughout my day. To know that You are near because you want to be.. because You are my redeemer and friend!
