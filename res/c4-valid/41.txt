WASHINGTON, Nov. 30, 2000 -- Lifetime Hoan Corp. is voluntarily recalling about 132,000 fondue sets to replace their burners. Some sets have alcohol burners that can produce high flames beyond the intended cooking surface of the fondue pot. Another set, which uses chafing fuel, is being recalled because the chafing fuel holder could tip as it burns down. Both problems present potential fire and burn hazards to consumers.
CPSC and Lifetime Hoan Corp. have received eight reports of burners producing high flames. No injuries or property damage has been reported.
The fondue sets were sold under the brand names Farberware速 (model nos. 86600 (two styles), 86700, 86702 and 76743) and Roshco速 (model no. 58903). The model number is on the box, not on the fondue set. The brand name is found on the box. The fondue sets are stainless steel and include various components, including a fondue pot, burner, and fondue forks. Only the burners sold with these fondue sets are being recalled, not the entire fondue sets. Lifetime Hoan Corp. will help consumers identify if their burner is recalled.
Department, kitchen and home stores nationwide sold the fondue sets from June 1999 through October 2000 for about $20.
Consumers should stop using the burners immediately and contact the company to find out how to dispose of the burners. Consumers with recalled alcohol burners will be sent a $4 coupon toward the purchase of Sterno速 canned chafing fuel. Consumers with recalled chafing fuel holders (model 86702 only) will be sent a new chafing fuel holder. Consumers should contact Lifetime Hoan Corp. at (877) 523-7190.

Consumers that have recessed lights with 5-inch exterior glass rings should call Cooper Lighting. The firm will provide instructions on how to remove the glass ring assembly to check lights to see if they are part of this recall.

WASHINGTON, Nov. 14, 2000 -- Emerson Tool Co. is recalling about 3.7 million Craftsman radial arm saws for repair. These radial arm saws were sold without a guard that covers the entire blade. Consumers have come into contact with the blade or have been hit by pieces of wood kicked back by the saws, resulting in severe injuries.
CPSC and Emerson have received about 300 reports of injuries while using these saws. Injuries include hand and finger amputations; lacerated hands, arms and fingers; fractured hands and fingers; and facial injuries.
Emerson is offering a free repair kit that provides a complete blade guard. Consumers should stop using their Craftsman radial arm saws immediately and call Emerson Tool Co. to determine if their saw is recalled and to ensure that they have proper safety and use instructions. Consumers should have the model and serial numbers of their saw available when they call.
The recalled Craftsman 8-, 8-, 9- and 10-inch radial arm saws have a model number beginning with 113, usually located on the base of the saw. The brand name "Craftsman速" and store name "Sears" are written on the saws.
Sears stores and catalogs sold the 8-, 9- and 10-inch saws from 1958 through 1992. The 8-inch saws were sold from 1990 through 1995. The saws sold for between $100 and $700, depending on the model, year purchased and accessories.
For older model saws and others that cannot accept the new guard, Emerson will provide $100 for the return of the saw carriage. Consumers must contact Emerson to receive a free repair kit or to return their saw carriage. Saws should not be returned to Sears.
The new guarding system provides a substantial safety improvement over guarding systems manufactured before 1993. Even if consumers have purchased a lower guard for their saw, they should still replace it with the new guard system.

WASHINGTON, Nov. 2, 2000 -- The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) and the Window Covering Safety Council are announcing a recall to repair horizontal window blinds to prevent the risk of strangulation to young children. The recall involves millions of window blinds with pull cords and inner cords that can form a loop and cause strangulation. About 85 million window blinds are sold each year.
Since 1991, CPSC has received reports of 130 strangulations involving cords on window blinds. 114 strangulations involve the outer pull cords, and 16 involve the inner cords that hold the blind slats.
In 1995, CPSC worked with the window covering industry to redesign new window blinds to eliminate the outer loop on the end of pull cords and provide free repair kits so consumers could fix their existing blinds. CPSC issued a safety alert (pdf format) about this hazard and what consumers can do about it, including a detailed description of the free repair kits. Window blinds sold since 1995 no longer have pull cords ending in loops.
Last year, CPSC began a new investigation of window blind deaths. In an extensive review of incidents, CPSC found that children could also become entangled in the inner cords that are used to raise the slats of blinds. These entrapments occur when a young child pulls on an inner cord and it forms a loop that the child can hang in. All of these deaths involved children in cribs placed next to windows. In most cases, the outer pull cords were placed out of reach, but the children strangled when they pulled on the inner cords of the blinds. The strangulation victims ranged in age from 9 months to 17 months.
As a result of the new CPSC investigation, the industry has further redesigned window blinds. Newly manufactured blinds have attachments on the pull cords so that the inner cords can't form a loop if pulled by a young child. Consumers with existing blinds should have them repaired. The repair can be done in minutes without removing the blinds.
Consumers who have window blinds with cords in their homes should call the Window Covering Safety Council toll-free (800) 506-4636 to receive a free repair kit for each set of blinds in the home. You can also visit their web site -- www.windowcoverings.org -- to get more information on checking your window covering. The repair kit will include small plastic attachments to prevent the inner cords from being pulled loose.
The kit also includes safety tassels for pre-1995 window blinds with outer pull cords ending in loops. Consumers should cut the loops and install a safety tassel at the end of each pull cord. Consumers who have vertical blinds, draperies or pleated shades with continuous loop cords should request special tie-downs to prevent strangulation in those window coverings.
Parents should keep window covering cords and chains permanently out of the reach of children. Never place a child's crib within reach of a window blind. Unless the cords can be completely removed from the child's reach, including when the child climbs on furniture, CPSC recommends that parents never knot or tie the cords together because this creates a new loop in which a child could become entangled.
Consumers who have young children may wish to consider purchasing cordless window coverings. These are made by a number of firms.
