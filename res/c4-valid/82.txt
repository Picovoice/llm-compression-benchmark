Everything you loved about the original UR22, now with the addition of iOS support - and a 5vDC input for interfacing (and powering) from your iPad and iPhone, for true mobile recording application!
Highlighting two industry-acclaimed D-PRE microphone preamps, class-leading 24-bit/192 kHz converters and a rock-solid metal housing, the Steinberg UR22 USB Audio Interface provides pure sound wherever you are. With a dedicated high-impedance switch, a separate headphones jack and phantom power supply, this portable 2-in/2-out device is the perfect choice for mobile musicians, touring DJs and everyone in between.
Together with the included Cubase DAW running on your PC or Mac computer, the UR22 audio and MIDI interface is a full-fledged mobile recording studio defined through total mobility, ultra-solid build and superb sound quality.
The microphone preamp is one of the key factors in recording - and that's why the UR22 interface is equipped with two stellar-sounding D-PREs. These preamps are the culmination of years of development by the experts at Yamaha. The result is a truly transparent and beautifully detailed sound that is unrivaled in this class. Whether you're looking to record acoustic instruments, vocals, an electric guitar or ambient textures, with the UR22 you can easily capture any audio source.
The UR22 is addicted to touring. It's small enough to be rushed from gig to gig and rugged enough to withstand all the rigors of the road. Built to the most exacting standards by Yamaha's experienced engineers, the UR22's full metal chassis is reassuringly solid. You're free to hit it with your drumstick, throw it into the tour bus or simply open a beer with it "- thanks to its impressive manufacturing quality the tour-tested UR22 is always ready to roll.
And regardless of its size, the UR22 exhibits all the core features of its bigger brothers, the UR824 and the UR28M, allowing you to realize rock-solid recordings without restrictions. Simply connect it via USB to your computer and start making music without any additional power supply - and always in class-leading sound quality.
Best of all, the UR22 offers latency-free hardware monitoring - what you play is what you immediately hear. The Mix knob allows you to seamlessly blend between the direct signal of your instrument and the output signal of your host. And thanks to the independent headphones and main output controls you can adjust the monitor and phones level individually. The MIDI I/O allows you to connect your keyboard or any other MIDI-compatible control device, such as pad controllers, footswitches and sound modules. Two TRS outputs, ultra-stable drivers and a USB 2.0 connection complement the feature set of this professional yet affordable device.
The UR22 is compatible with all major audio editing, mastering and music production software supporting the ASIO, Core Audio or WDM standard.
Plus, the UR22 comes bundled with Cubase AI, a lean version of Steinberg's popular DAW. Based on the same core technologies as Steinberg's highly acclaimed Cubase DAW, the AI version offers a comprehensive feature set for composing, recording, editing and mixing. Run it together with the UR22 audio interface and you get a one-stop solution for recording music in studio quality.
Cubase users will benefit from additional features, such as auto-setup functionality, which enables the complete I/O setup to be handled directly from within Cubase. Once your UR22 interface has been installed, Cubase detects the device and automatically embeds it into Cubase's production environment - it couldn't be easier.

Just bought the UR22mkII two days ago. Thought I was having trouble getting it to operate properly in my DAW. Kept disconnecting and crashing the software. And it would not connect to my new iPad either! I was ready to return it for a full refund. I then called Yamaha Canada for help. They were great! Turns out that it was my expensive USB cable that was causing all my woes. Yamaha told me to try the USB cable included with the unit. I thought, what the heck! As soon as I connected it up, no more issues with crashing of my DAW. Wow! And as soon as I connected it up to my iPad? It worked flawlessly. Just a tip connecting it up to your iPad/iToy... If you don't have yet, I would recommend the newer Lightning to USB 3 Camera Adapter connector. It's not cheap at $49 plus HST, but it works the best. Connect the factory included USB cable to the USB 3 Camera adapter, connect the iPad 12 watt charger with a lightning sync cable to the smaller port on the adapter, plug the adapter into the iPad, etc. Plug the USB cable into the UR. Make sure the back panel power selector switch on the UR is set to USB. Not 5 Volt. Do not plug a power adapter into the 5V port on the UR. You do not need it at all. One single Apple 12 watt power supply charges the iPad and powers the UR22mkII at the same time. No issues whatsoever. No heat issues with the charger either. If your iToy is on, the UR22mkII should be automatically recognized and the USB light on the UR will light up. You're now connected! Even though the iPad will not indicate this at all on the screen. It just works. Another little note (sorry!) the headphone monitor jack on the UR22mkII front panel will only output a mono signal (L&R panned center) while recording. Playback of a stereo track into the UR gives you a stereo output at the headphone jack. It is a little disconcerting at first, while recording in stereo, but it was designed this way on purpose. Not quite sure why, but not a deal breaker. All in all, this is one very clean sounding and very solid little interface. All the controls feel snug and firm. It could take a bit of a beating and stand up well. I highly recommend it.
Steinberg is a trusted brand and most people like this audio interface but mine has been consistently cutting out on me while listening to my music through my monitors. Sometimes it happens several times a minute. VERY annoying. There's a million troubleshooting options but some people have never found a cure. Fair warning.
I'm not a recording artist or musician BUT I do record audio and video and Live Stream webinars off my Windows 10 PC. I had been using a really nice Audio Technica AT 2005USB / XLR combo Dynamic mic for all my PC work and it has given me really nice results. But there are times when I need to go wireless and I just had no way to get my Sennheiser G3 Body Pack into the PC, so tried this Steinberg and I'm really impressed. The Drivers are super stable and my PC Instantly recognized the device. I took my regualr Mic which is normally connected to the PC and routed it into Input 1 and this thing took what was already really nice sound and just warmed it up and boosted it ever so slightly. So Foar so good, I got an improvement I wasnt even looking for. Then I hooked up the EW100 G3 Receiver to Input 2. And BINGO, wireless Mic straight into my PC! I'm happy! Just a couple of setting notes. On my Dynamic Mic, I had to adjust the gain all the way to full 10 out of 10, but it didnt add any noise it just rounded out the sound of an already good mic. For the Sennheiser wireless, I had to adjust the gain down to 2 out of 10 .... It's a great Unit. Solid Construction, looks good on the desk and travel friendly. I can see taking this on the road with me.
I'm using an older Mac Pro tower (OS X Yosemite) and Logic Pro X. I had some latency issues with my Focusrite Scarlett 2i2 (1st gen) that was about 6 years old. I figured it was time to look at a replacement. After reading many reviews and considering my budget and the features I needed, it seemed like this unit would be the better choice. I went to my local Long and McQuade here in Mississauga and picked one up. I was pleasantly surprised at how easily it setup. Just ran the install on the disk that came with it, rebooted, plugged it in and opened up Logic. It came right up and worked with no issues. There's a latency test you can do in Logic by enabling an I/O plugin on the channel, pluggin in a patch cable from the output to an input and doing a ping. The results report your latency. On my Focusrite I was getting +77. On the Steinberg UR22 MkII I'm getting +1. Wow! Quite a difference. Of course as you add in plugins and venture your way to a more full mix, the latency will increase on any unit, but +1 is a nice starting point. Almost 0 latency. Sound quality wise, I've done extensive tests between this and my Focusrite Scarlett 2i2 and I find the UR 22 MkII is a little more unaffected. On the 2i2 it has a tiny bit of a affected top end. Just slightly enough that it feels like it's eq'd. Still sounds great. But I think the UR 22 MkII is more natural. I'm splitting hairs here but it's at worst, the same and possibly even a bit better. Not to mention the UR 22 goes up to 192khz if you want. I'm recording at 92khz now but did comparative test at 44.1 and 48khz. Finally, on build quality. It's built like a tank. It weighs at least twice what the Focusrite Scarlett 2i2 unit weighs. I put it on my desk and it doesn't move.
Works flawlessly in any DAW, sounds good and is hassle free! I own the Mark 1 but Im sure the newer model is even better.
