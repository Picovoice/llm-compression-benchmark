A Green Community Many cities in the United States are developing "green communities." A green community is intended to reduce the use of energy and consists of houses, apartments, and nearby businesses. Grocery stores, restaurants, and movie theaters are all within walking distance of the homes in the community. People travel shorter distances to their schools and jobs.
