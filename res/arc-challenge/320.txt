In the equatorial Pacific Ocean, upwelling moves cold, deep sea water to the surface. This water is rich in nutrients and dissolved carbon dioxide gas. During an El Niño event, upwelling declines. This causes surface waters to rise in temperature. Which of the following is most likely to occur in the equatorial Pacific Ocean during an El Niño year? (A) decrease in release of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere (B) increase in photosynthesis by algae in surface waters (C) increase in dissolved oxygen in surface waters (D) decrease in precipitation over ocean waters
Answer: A
