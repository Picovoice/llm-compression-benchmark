Some researchers believe that beta-carotene, which is found in carrots, may help humans live longer lives. A few scientists designed an experiment in which one-hundred people would be asked to take a double dose of beta-carotene daily for two years and another hundred people were given a placebo, a sugar pill, for the same amount of time.

(B) there are too many variables. (C) there is no experimental group. (D) it does not have a testable hypothesis.
