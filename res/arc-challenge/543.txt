Scientists have been able to insert genes from a spider into the genome of a domestic goat. When the goat matures, it produces milk that contains a protein found in spider webs. This protein can then be extracted and used to make strong but lightweight materials for bulletproof vests, automobiles, and aircraft. The change does not cause the goat any pain, but some people think that it is not right to add genes from the genome of one animal to another. Which word best describes this concern? (A) economic (B) biological (C) ethical (D) practical
Answer: C
