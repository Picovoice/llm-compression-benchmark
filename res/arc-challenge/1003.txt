Tide pools are habitats for several kinds of organisms that attach to the rocky surface and depend upon tides for food and oxygen. Sea stars present in these tide pools feed on mussels and other shellfish that have no other natural predators. How will it most likely impact species diversity if all of the sea stars are removed from the tide pool ecosystem? (A) Diversity will increase as the rate of predation decreases. (B) Diversity will decrease as competition for space increases. (C) Diversity will increase as the recycling of nutrients decreases. (D) Diversity will decrease as food and oxygen supplies increase.
