Now developed into a full-fledged resort, Tamarindo has not lost its edge as an exclusive surfing spot. Spots like Little Hawaii and Witch‚Äôs Rock are among the most legendary, thanks to aggressive swells and almost perfect weather.
A notorious surfing destination thanks to its six superb breakpoints and consistently great weather all year, Jeffrey‚Äôs Bay sees some picture-perfect waves roll onto its beaches, including ‚ÄúKitchen Windows,‚Äù ‚ÄúMagna Tubes‚Äù and ‚ÄúAlbatross.‚Äù It is no wonder the popular Billabong Surfing Festival attracts the world‚Äôs best surfers here every July ‚Äî the conditions are ideal.

The Corinth Canal is a junction of international sea communications and serves ships of all nationalities. It provides the shortest and safest sea-lane for ships coming from the Ionian sea, the Adriatic, Southern Italy, and those passing through the Straits or Messina en route to Eastern Mediterranean ports and on to the Black Sea and vice versa.The bridge makes an ideal place to set up a bungy jumping venue. The day I visited, I watched a few people do it- but I did not try it myself. Height of Jump: 78m.
Bungee Jumpers count the leap from the Ponte Colossus Bridge among the world‚Äôs Top Ten Bungee experiences. The platform is 152 meters above a forested gorge in the Italian Alps, located at the mid-point between the Northern Italian cities of Milan and Turin in Biella, Piedmont Province. The jump provides nearly 5 seconds of free-fall and night jumps are possible guaranteeing a totally unique experience.
Ironically, Colorado‚Äôs most famous bungee destination is one at which traditional bungee jumping is banned throughout the year.

We all love to go to parties or festivals, to have fun with friends, dancing with strangers, drinking alkohol and we can do that all night long or maybe a few days. Now I want to invite you at some parties, where I‚Äôam sure you can have a great time.
A celebration of the Thai New Year, Songkran may as well be the world‚Äôs biggest wet-tshirt contest. The festival takes place during Thailand‚Äôs hottest time of year, mid April, and partiers cool off by throwing containers of water, blasting Super Soakers and spraying garden hoses at one other. Although the original Songkran festival was a rather somber and reverent affair‚Äîa time to pay respect to elder, where the water hurling symbolized a spiritual cleansing‚Äîyoung people have helped push the festival in the direction of wet and wild revelry.
As the most well-known event of Loei province in the Northeastern Thailand, Phi Ta Khon is the ultimate yearly celebration. The Thailand Ghost Festival is well regarded as an annual event where revelers put on rather hilarious, yet ghostly, masks made of bamboo and wicker and join in the Ghost parade. Regarded as a rain-making ceremony, this spooky festivity is held annually in the beginning of rainy season. This year the event will be held on 22-24 June at Dan Sai District of Loei province. Unlike Halloween, the ghosts and poltergeists in Phi Ta Khon seek their fun under full daylight.
The island of Ko Pha Ngan in Thailand hosts an all-night beach party before or after every full moon. The tradition began in the ‚Äô80s as a simple gathering to give thanks to a group of tourists, and over time has evolved into a 20,000-strong celebration that is sure to be on every party-loving tourist‚Äôs itinerary. In addition to the endless, pounding music and attractive crowd, the event boasts features like fire skipping ropes, infamous ‚Äúbuckets‚Äù of alcoholic beverages and a pretty colorful drug culture. In other words, there aren‚Äôt a lot of people going home alone after this one.
When I‚Äôam at the beach and the sand is hot, some of the best thing i can wait for is the breeze. But after a few minutes of waiting, I see one bar and do you know what I‚Äôam thinking about ‚Ä¶ Yes ‚ÄúI need a drink‚Äù, but not just a drink. I want some special drinks to feel the coolness in this hot day on the beach.
Pour malibu rum in a highball glass, and top with orange juice. Stir. Add grenadine by tilting glass and pouring grenadine down side. (by flipping the bottle vertically very quickly). The grenadine should go straight to the bottom and then rise up slowly through the drink. Enjoy!
