Ola Gjeilo is one of the most frequently performed composers in the choral world. An accomplished pianist, improvisations over his own published choral pieces have become a trademark of his collaborations across the world. Although Norwegian by birth, it is perhaps Ola's adopted country of America that has influenced the composer's distinctive soundworld the most, evolving a style that is both contemporary and familiar; thick harmonies and rich textures recall film score - music that forms a major part of the composer's inspiration.
Ola grew up in a musically eclectic home listening to classical, jazz, pop and folk, a broad background he later incorporated into his classical composition studies at The Juilliard School, and the Royal College of Music, London, and currently as a New York City-based full-time composer.

"Sanctus" is atmospheric and intense, featuring contrasts of ethereal melody lines supported by stately, rich harmonies.

The text for Dreamweaver is based on parts of the well-known Norwegian medieval folk poem Draumkvedet, an epic ballad that has a lot in common with Dante's The Divine Comedy. The protagonist, Olav ï¿½steson, falls asleep on Christmas Eve and sleeps for thirteen days. He wakes up and rides to church to describe his dreams to the congregation about his brave, beautiful, terrifying, and ultimately redeeming journey through the afterlife. For this composition, the Draumkvedet poem has been adapted into a playful interpretation in English penned by Charles Anthony Silvestri.
