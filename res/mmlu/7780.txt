Suppose that a test statistic has associated with it a p-value of 0.08. Which one of the following statements is true?

(i) If the size of the test were exactly 8%, we would be indifferent between rejecting and not rejecting the null hypothesis

(ii) The null would be rejected if a 10% size of test were used

(iii) The null would not be rejected if a 1% size of test were used

(iv) The null would be rejected if a 5% size of test were used.
A. (ii) and (iv) only
B. (i) and (iii) only
C. (i), (ii), and (iii) only
D. (i), (ii), (iii), and (iv)
Answer: C

Answer: C

Suppose now that a researcher wishes to use information criteria to determine the optimal lag length for a VAR. 500 observations are available for the bi-variate VAR, and the values of the determinant of the variance-covariance matrix of residuals are 0.0336, 0.0169, 0.0084, and 0.0062 for 1, 2, 3, and 4 lags respectively. What is the optimal model order according to Akaike's information criterion?
A. 1 lag
B. 2 lags
C. 3 lags
D. 4 lags
Answer: C

If OLS is applied separately to each equation that is part of a simultaneous system, the resulting estimates will be

Answer: C
