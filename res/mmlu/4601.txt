Answer: D

Where do most short-period comets come from and how do we know?
A. The Kuiper belt; short period comets tend to be in the plane of the solar system just like the Kuiper belt.
B. The Kuiper belt; short period comets tend to come from random directions indicating a spherical distribution of comets called the Kuiper belt.
C. The asteroid belt; short period comets have orbital periods similar to asteroids like Vesta and are found in the plane of the solar system just like the asteroid belt.
D. The Oort cloud; short period comets tend to be in the plane of the solar system just like the Oort cloud.

A. A planet once formed here but it was broken apart by a catastrophic collision.
B. There was not enough material in this part of the solar nebula to form a planet.
C. There was too much rocky material to form a terrestrial planet but not enough gaseous material to form a jovian planet.
