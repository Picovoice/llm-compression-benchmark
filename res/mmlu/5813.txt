Which of the following best accounts for the negative slope of the liquid-solid equilibrium line in the phase diagram for water?
A. H2O(s) has a greater density than H2O(l), which causes the solid to form liquid under high pressure conditions.
B. H2O(s) has a greater density than H2O(l), which results from the hydrogen bonds formed between water molecules.
C. H2O(s) has a lower density than H2O(l) which results from the crystalline framework that forms due to hydrogen bonds.
D. H2O(s) has a lower density than H2O(l) which causes the solid to form liquid under low pressure conditions.
Answer: C
