Answer: A

A mutation in a bacterial enzyme changed a previously polar amino acid into a nonpolar amino acid. This amino acid was located at a site distant from the enzyme’s active site. How might this mutation alter the enzyme’s substrate specificity?
A. By changing the enzyme’s pH optimum
B. By changing the enzyme’s location in the cell
C. By changing the shape of the protein
D. An amino acid change away from the active site cannot alter the enzyme’s substrate specificity.
Answer: C

Answer: D

An eager AP Biology student interested in studying osmosis and the movement of water in solutions took a dialysis bag containing a 0.5 M solution and placed it into a beaker containing a 0.6 M solution. If this bag were instead placed into a beaker of distilled water, what would be the expected result?
A. There will be a net flow of water out of the bag, causing it to decrease in size.
B. There will be a net flow of water into the bag, causing it to swell in size.
C. The bag will remain the exact same size because no water will move at all.
D. The solute will flow out of the dialysis bag into the beaker.
Answer: B
