Answer: D

A new compound is synthesized and found to be a monoprotic acid with a molar mass of 248 g/mol. When 0.0050 mol of this acid are dissolved in 0.500 L of water, the pH is measured as 3.89. What is the pKa of this acid?
A. 3.89
B. 7.78
C. 5.78
D. 2.33
Answer: C

A solution contains 2.00 mole of acetic acid, CH3COOH, and 1.00 mole of calcium acetate, Ca(CH3COO)2. The solution is able to resist the addition of a small amount of strong acid or strong base with only minor changes in the pH of the solution. Larger quantities of strong acid or strong base can cause a significant change in pH. How many moles of nitric acid, HNO3, may be added before the pH begins to change significantly?
A. 0.500 mole
B. 1.00 mole
C. 2.00 mole
D. 3.00 mole
Answer: C

A 2.0 L flask holds 0.40 g of helium gas. If the helium is evacuated into a larger container while the temperature is held constant, what will the effect on the entropy of the helium be?
A. It will remain constant as the number of helium molecules does not change.
B. It will decrease as the gas will be more ordered in the larger flask.
C. It will decrease because the molecules will collide with the sides of the larger flask less often than they did in the smaller flask.
D. It will increase as the gas molecules will be more dispersed in the larger flask.
Answer: D
