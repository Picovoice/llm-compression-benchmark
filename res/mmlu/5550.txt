Answer: A

A mutation in a bacterial enzyme changed a previously polar amino acid into a nonpolar amino acid. This amino acid was located at a site distant from the enzyme’s active site. How might this mutation alter the enzyme’s substrate specificity?
A. By changing the enzyme’s pH optimum
B. By changing the enzyme’s location in the cell
C. By changing the shape of the protein
D. An amino acid change away from the active site cannot alter the enzyme’s substrate specificity.
Answer: C

Homologous structures are often cited as evidence for the process of natural selection. All of the following are examples of homologous structures EXCEPT
A. the wings of a bird and the wings of a bat
B. the flippers of a whale and the arms of a man
C. the pectoral fins of a porpoise and the flippers of a seal

Answer: D

More than a dozen species of Darwin's finches with various specialized adaptations inhabit the Galápagos Islands. Each species possesses a specialized adaptation for obtaining food. Why is it that similar adaptations do not exist among the finches of the South American mainland, the presumed origin of the Galápagos finch ancestor?
A. The various foods available on the mainland are different than those on the Galápagos Islands.
B. South American predators limited evolution of the mainland finch.
C. Reproductive isolation is not possible on the mainland.
D. The available niches that the Darwin's finches exploited on the Galápagos Islands were already occupied by other species of birds on the mainland.
Answer: D
