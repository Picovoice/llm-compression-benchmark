(i) If the size of the test were exactly 8%, we would be indifferent between rejecting and not rejecting the null hypothesis

(ii) The null would be rejected if a 10% size of test were used

(iii) The null would not be rejected if a 1% size of test were used

(iv) The null would be rejected if a 5% size of test were used.
A. (ii) and (iv) only
B. (i) and (iii) only
C. (i), (ii), and (iii) only
D. (i), (ii), (iii), and (iv)
Answer: C

A. It will be biased
B. It will be inconsistent

Answer: C

Suppose now that a researcher wishes to use information criteria to determine the optimal lag length for a VAR. 500 observations are available for the bi-variate VAR, and the values of the determinant of the variance-covariance matrix of residuals are 0.0336, 0.0169, 0.0084, and 0.0062 for 1, 2, 3, and 4 lags respectively. What is the optimal model order according to Akaike's information criterion?
A. 1 lag
B. 2 lags
C. 3 lags
D. 4 lags
Answer: C

Which of the following is correct concerning logit and probit models?
A. They use a different method of transforming the model so that the probabilities lie between zero and one
B. The logit model can result in too many observations falling at exactly zero or exactly one
C. For the logit model, the marginal effect of a change in one of the explanatory variables is simply the estimate of the parameter attached to that variable, whereas this is not the case for the probit model
D. The probit model is based on a cumulative logistic function
Answer: A
