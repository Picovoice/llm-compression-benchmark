Answer: D

A new compound is synthesized and found to be a monoprotic acid with a molar mass of 248 g/mol. When 0.0050 mol of this acid are dissolved in 0.500 L of water, the pH is measured as 3.89. What is the pKa of this acid?
A. 3.89
B. 7.78
C. 5.78
D. 2.33
Answer: C

A solution contains 2.00 mole of acetic acid, CH3COOH, and 1.00 mole of calcium acetate, Ca(CH3COO)2. The solution is able to resist the addition of a small amount of strong acid or strong base with only minor changes in the pH of the solution. Larger quantities of strong acid or strong base can cause a significant change in pH. How many moles of nitric acid, HNO3, may be added before the pH begins to change significantly?
A. 0.500 mole
B. 1.00 mole
C. 2.00 mole
D. 3.00 mole
Answer: C

Hydrogen fluoride, HF, is a liquid at 15°C. All other hydrogen halides (represented by HX, where X is any other halogen) are gases at the same temperature. Why?
A. Fluorine has a very high electronegativity; therefore the H-F bond is stronger than any other H-X bond.
B. HF is smaller than any other H-X molecule; therefore it exhibits stronger London dispersion forces.
C. The dipoles in a HF molecule exhibit a particularly strong attraction force to the dipoles in other HF molecules.
D. The H-F bond is the most ionic in character compared to all other hydrogen halides.
Answer: C
