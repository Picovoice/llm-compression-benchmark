In Brumley and Boneh’s paper on side-channel attacks, why does blinding prevent the timing attack from working?
A. Blinding prevents the server from using the CRT optimization, which is essential to the timing attack.
B. Blinding changes the p and q primes that are used, so an adversary cannot learn the server’s true p and q values.
C. Blinding randomizes the ciphertext being decrypted, thus obscuring the correlation between an adversary’s input and the timing differences.
D. Blinding adds a random amount of time to the decryption due to the multiplication and division by the blinding random value r, which obscures the timing differences used in the attack.
Answer: C
