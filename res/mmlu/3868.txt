Recent genomic analyses of Neandertals and modern human populations indicate that:
A. between 1% and 4% of the genome of modern humans with European and Asian ancestry originated from Neandertal populations, most likely through interbreeding.
B. Neandertal populations were entirely distinct and separate from anatomically modern humans, with no evidence of interbreeding.
C. anatomically modern humans throughout the world uniformly share approximately 16% of their genome with Neandertal populations.
