The following are multiple choice questions (with answers) about college mathematics.

Let V be the set of all real polynomials p(x). Let transformations T, S be defined on V by T:p(x) -> xp(x) and S:p(x) -> p'(x) = d/dx p(x), and interpret (ST)(p(x)) as S(T(p(x))). Which of the following is true?
A. ST = 0
B. ST = T
C. ST = TS
D. ST - TS is the identity map of V onto itself.
Answer: D

A tank initially contains a salt solution of 3 grams of salt dissolved in 100 liters of water. A salt solution containing 0.02 grams of salt per liter of water is sprayed into the tank at a rate of 4 liters per minute. The sprayed solution is continually mixed with the salt solution in the tank, and the mixture flows out of the tank at a rate of 4 liters per minute. If the mixing is instantaneous, how many grams of salt are in the tank after 100 minutes have elapsed?
A. 2
B. 2 - e^-2
C. 2 + e^-2
D. 2 + e^-4
Answer: D
