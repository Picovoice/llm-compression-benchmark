Suppose now that a researcher wishes to use information criteria to determine the optimal lag length for a VAR. 500 observations are available for the bi-variate VAR, and the values of the determinant of the variance-covariance matrix of residuals are 0.0336, 0.0169, 0.0084, and 0.0062 for 1, 2, 3, and 4 lags respectively. What is the optimal model order according to Akaike's information criterion?
A. 1 lag
B. 2 lags
C. 3 lags
D. 4 lags
Answer: C

A researcher tests for structural stability in the following regression model:

A. The RSS for the whole sample
B. The RSS for the first sub-sample
C. The RSS for the second sub-sample
D. The sum of the RSS for the first and second sub-samples
