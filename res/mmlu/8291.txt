Answer: A

From the solubility rules, which of the following is true?
A. All chlorides, bromides, and iodides are soluble
B. All sulfates are soluble
C. All hydroxides are soluble
D. All ammonium-containing compounds are soluble
Answer: D

A new compound is synthesized and found to be a monoprotic acid with a molar mass of 248 g/mol. When 0.0050 mol of this acid are dissolved in 0.500 L of water, the pH is measured as 3.89. What is the pKa of this acid?
A. 3.89
B. 7.78
C. 5.78
D. 2.33
Answer: C

A solution contains 2.00 mole of acetic acid, CH3COOH, and 1.00 mole of calcium acetate, Ca(CH3COO)2. The solution is able to resist the addition of a small amount of strong acid or strong base with only minor changes in the pH of the solution. Larger quantities of strong acid or strong base can cause a significant change in pH. How many moles of nitric acid, HNO3, may be added before the pH begins to change significantly?
A. 0.500 mole
B. 1.00 mole
C. 2.00 mole
D. 3.00 mole
Answer: C

Formation of a solution can often be visualized as a three-step process. Step 1. Solvent molecules are separated from each other to make space for the solute. Step 2. Solute molecules are separated so they fit into spaces in the solvent. Step 3. Separated solute and solvent are brought together, filling in the spaces. Which of the following statements about the energy involved in the above is correct?
A. Steps 1 and 2 are exothermic, and step 3 is endothermic.
B. Steps 1 and 2 are endothermic, and step 3 is exothermic.
C. All three steps are exothermic.
D. All three steps are endothermic.
