The following are multiple choice questions (with answers) about high school biology.

Which of the following is not a way to form recombinant DNA?
A. Translation
B. Conjugation
C. Specialized transduction
D. Transformation
Answer: A

A mutation in a bacterial enzyme changed a previously polar amino acid into a nonpolar amino acid. This amino acid was located at a site distant from the enzyme’s active site. How might this mutation alter the enzyme’s substrate specificity?
A. By changing the enzyme’s pH optimum
B. By changing the enzyme’s location in the cell
C. By changing the shape of the protein
D. An amino acid change away from the active site cannot alter the enzyme’s substrate specificity.
Answer: C

C. Plasma membrane–Golgi apparatus–ribosome–secretory vesicle–rough ER

Homologous structures are often cited as evidence for the process of natural selection. All of the following are examples of homologous structures EXCEPT
A. the wings of a bird and the wings of a bat
B. the flippers of a whale and the arms of a man
C. the pectoral fins of a porpoise and the flippers of a seal

Answer: D

Hydrangea flowers have one gene for flower color. Plants of the same genetic variety have flowers that range in color from blue to pink with the color varying due to the type of soil in which they are grown. Which of the following statement best explains this phenomenon?
A. The alleles for flower color show incomplete dominance where neither trait is dominant; expression of the genes shows a blending of traits.
B. The alleles for flower color are codominant; both traits show depending on the environment.
C. In this case, the environment alters the expression of a trait.
D. The genes for flower color show polygenic inheritance.
Answer: C
