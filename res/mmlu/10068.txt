A new compound is synthesized and found to be a monoprotic acid with a molar mass of 248 g/mol. When 0.0050 mol of this acid are dissolved in 0.500 L of water, the pH is measured as 3.89. What is the pKa of this acid?
A. 3.89
B. 7.78
C. 5.78
D. 2.33
Answer: C

A solution contains 2.00 mole of acetic acid, CH3COOH, and 1.00 mole of calcium acetate, Ca(CH3COO)2. The solution is able to resist the addition of a small amount of strong acid or strong base with only minor changes in the pH of the solution. Larger quantities of strong acid or strong base can cause a significant change in pH. How many moles of nitric acid, HNO3, may be added before the pH begins to change significantly?
A. 0.500 mole
B. 1.00 mole
C. 2.00 mole
D. 3.00 mole
Answer: C

Which net ionic equation below represents a possible reaction that takes place when a strip of magnesium metal is oxidized by a solution of chromium (III) nitrate?
A. Mg(s) + Cr(NO3)3(aq) → Mg2+(aq) + Cr3+(aq) + 3NO3-(aq)
B. 3Mg(s) + 2Cr3+ → 3Mg2+ + 2Cr(s)
C. Mg(s) + Cr3+ → Mg2+ + Cr(s)
D. 3Mg(s) + 2Cr(NO3)3(aq) → 3Mg2+(aq) + 2Cr(s) + NO3-(aq)
Answer: B
