Let HH be a Merkle-Damgard hash function is H:X^{\leq L} \to TH:X^≤L  →T. Construct a MAC from this HH as follows: \ \ S(k,m) = H(k \| m)  S(k,m)=H(k∥m). This mac is insecure because:
A. Given H(k \| m)H(k∥m) anyone can compute H(w \| k \| m \| \text{PB})H(w∥k∥m∥PB) for any ww
B. Given H(k \| m)H(k∥m) anyone can compute H(k \| m \| w)H(k∥m∥w) for any ww
C. Given H(k \| m)H(k∥m) anyone can compute H(k \| m \| \text{PB} \| w)H(k∥m∥PB∥w) for any ww
D. Anyone can compute H( k \| m )H(k∥m) for any mm
Answer: C
