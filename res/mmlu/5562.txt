A. muscle weakness.
B. gain in body mass.
C. muscle cramps.
D. loss of electrolytes.
Answer: B

A certain molecule acts by binding to cytochrome oxidase A3, the final enzyme in the electron transport chain. Administration of a large dose of this substance to a human would likely:
A. Lead to death due to an inability of the cell to pass electrons to oxygen, thus stopping aerobic respiration and asphyxiating the cells.
B. Lead to death due to an inadequate supply of ADP to accept a phosphate group at the ATP synthase enzyme.
C. Have no effect as cells would switch which macronutrient they metabolize to circumvent the blocked biochemical pathway.
D. Increase the cell’s ATP production as negative feedback would cause the cell to up-regulate anaerobic pathways.
Answer: A
