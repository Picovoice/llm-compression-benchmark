Answer: D

A new compound is synthesized and found to be a monoprotic acid with a molar mass of 248 g/mol. When 0.0050 mol of this acid are dissolved in 0.500 L of water, the pH is measured as 3.89. What is the pKa of this acid?
A. 3.89
B. 7.78
C. 5.78
D. 2.33
Answer: C

A solution contains 2.00 mole of acetic acid, CH3COOH, and 1.00 mole of calcium acetate, Ca(CH3COO)2. The solution is able to resist the addition of a small amount of strong acid or strong base with only minor changes in the pH of the solution. Larger quantities of strong acid or strong base can cause a significant change in pH. How many moles of nitric acid, HNO3, may be added before the pH begins to change significantly?
A. 0.500 mole
B. 1.00 mole
C. 2.00 mole
D. 3.00 mole
Answer: C

Fluorine has a normal boiling point of 85 K, and chlorine boils at 239 K. The Cl2 molecule is much larger than F2 (atomic radius is 99 pm for chlorine and is 64 pm for fluorine). Which is the best reason for the large difference in boiling points?
A. Chlorine has a higher dipole moment than fluorine.
B. The intramolecular bonds in Cl2 are much weaker than those in F2.
C. The Cl2 electron clouds are much more polarizable than the F2 electron clouds, resulting in much stronger London forces.
D. The mass of chlorine is much greater than the mass of fluorine.
Answer: C
