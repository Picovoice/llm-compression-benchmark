Answer: A

A mutation in a bacterial enzyme changed a previously polar amino acid into a nonpolar amino acid. This amino acid was located at a site distant from the enzyme’s active site. How might this mutation alter the enzyme’s substrate specificity?
A. By changing the enzyme’s pH optimum
B. By changing the enzyme’s location in the cell
C. By changing the shape of the protein
D. An amino acid change away from the active site cannot alter the enzyme’s substrate specificity.
Answer: C

Answer: D

During oxidative phosphorylation, the energy needed to drive ATP synthesis comes from one source. Which of the following statements states the immediate source of that energy?
A. Electrons flow down an electron transport chain as they are attracted to oxygen.
B. The transfer of a phosphate group to ADP is exergonic.
C. The bonding of electrons to oxygen at the end of the chain releases energy.
