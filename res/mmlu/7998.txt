Answer: D

A new compound is synthesized and found to be a monoprotic acid with a molar mass of 248 g/mol. When 0.0050 mol of this acid are dissolved in 0.500 L of water, the pH is measured as 3.89. What is the pKa of this acid?
A. 3.89
B. 7.78
C. 5.78
D. 2.33
Answer: C

A solution contains 2.00 mole of acetic acid, CH3COOH, and 1.00 mole of calcium acetate, Ca(CH3COO)2. The solution is able to resist the addition of a small amount of strong acid or strong base with only minor changes in the pH of the solution. Larger quantities of strong acid or strong base can cause a significant change in pH. How many moles of nitric acid, HNO3, may be added before the pH begins to change significantly?
A. 0.500 mole
B. 1.00 mole
C. 2.00 mole
D. 3.00 mole
Answer: C

Three 25.00 mL samples of approximately 0.10 M phenol, C6H5OH, Ka = 1.0 Ã— 10^-10 were removed from a container and placed in separate 250 mL beakers. The samples were titrated with standard potassium hydroxide, KOH, solution. Cresol red was the acid-base indicator used in the titration. The samples required 31.75, 32.38, and 41.75 mL to reach the endpoint. Which of the following might explain why one of the samples required significantly more base to reach the endpoint?
A. The indicator was added too late.
B. The wrong indicator was used.
C. There was a base contaminating the unclean beaker.
D. There was an acid contaminating the unclean beaker.
Answer: D
