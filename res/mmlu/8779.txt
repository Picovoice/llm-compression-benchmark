According to Socrates, an unexamined life is not worth living; and it certainly could not be a virtuous life.  Why not?
A. Because if someone did not know how to act virtuously, he or she would still be considered virtuous by others who also did not know the principles for good living.
B. Because since Socrates was a philosopher, he of course thought that people who examined their lives philosophically were more virtuous than those who did not.
C. Because without knowing the rationale for why one should act in a particular way, one does not know whether actions are justified and ought to be repeated.
D. Because a virtuous life would be one in which someone does what the rest of the society says is right, and that means examining views other than one's own.
