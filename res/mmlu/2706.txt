The following are multiple choice questions (with answers) about college computer science.

Which of the following regular expressions is equivalent to (describes the same set of strings as) (a* + b)*(c + d)?
A. a*(c + d)+ b(c + d)
B. a*(c + d)* + b(c + d)*

Answer: D

A certain pipelined RISC machine has 8 general-purpose registers R0, R1, . . . , R7 and supports the following operations.
ADD Rs1, Rs2, Rd Add Rs1 to Rs2 and put the sum in Rd
MUL Rs1, Rs2, Rd Multiply Rs1 by Rs2 and put the product in Rd
An operation normally takes one cycle; however, an operation takes two cycles if it produces a result required by the immediately following operation in an operation sequence. Consider the expression AB + ABC + BC, where variables A, B, C are located in registers R0, R1, R2. If the contents of these three registers must not be modified, what is the minimum number of clock cycles required for an operation sequence that computes the value of AB + ABC + BC?
A. 5
B. 6
C. 7
D. 8
Answer: B

The Singleton design pattern is used to guarantee that only a single instance of a class may be instantiated. Which of the following is (are) true of this design pattern?
I. The Singleton class has a static factory method to provide its instance.
II. The Singleton class can be a subclass of another class.
III. The Singleton class has a private constructor.
A. I only
B. II only
C. III only
D. I, II, and III
Answer: D

A compiler generates code for the following assignment statement.
G := (A + B) * C - (D + E) * F
The target machine has a single accumulator and a single-address instruction set consisting of instructions load, store, add, subtract, and multiply. For the arithmetic operations, the left operand is taken from the accumulator and the result appears in the accumulator. The smallest possible number of instructions in the resulting code is
A. 5
B. 6
C. 7
D. 9
Answer: D

Consider a computer design in which multiple processors, each with a private cache memory, share global memory using a single bus. This bus is the critical system resource. Each processor can execute one instruction every 500 nanoseconds as long as memory references are satisfied by its local cache. When a cache miss occurs, the processor is delayed for an additional 2,000 nanoseconds. During half of this additional delay, the bus is dedicated to serving the cache miss. During the other half, the processor cannot continue, but the bus is free to service requests from other processors. On average, each instruction requires 2 memory references. On average, cache misses occur on 1 percent of references. What proportion of the capacity of the bus would a single processor consume, ignoring delays due to competition from other processors?
A. 1/50
B. 1/27
C. 1/25
D. 2/27
Answer: B

Let T be a depth-first search tree of a connected undirected graph G. For each vertex v of T, let pre(v) be the number of nodes visited up to and including v during a preorder traversal of T, and post(v) be the number of nodes visited up to and including v during a postorder traversal of T. The lowest common ancestor of vertices u and v in T is a vertex w of T such that w is an ancestor of both u and v, and no child of w is an ancestor of both u and v. Let (u, v) be an edge in G that is not in T, such that pre(u) < pre(v). Which of the following statements about u and v must be true?
I. post(u) < post(v)
II. u is an ancestor of v in T.
III. If w is the lowest common ancestor of u and v in T, then w = u.
A. I only
B. II only
C. III only
D. II and III
