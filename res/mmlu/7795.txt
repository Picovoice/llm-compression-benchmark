C. SO2
D. Al(NO3)3
Answer: C

D. Si(CH3)4
Answer: A

From the solubility rules, which of the following is true?
A. All chlorides, bromides, and iodides are soluble
B. All sulfates are soluble
C. All hydroxides are soluble
D. All ammonium-containing compounds are soluble
Answer: D

A new compound is synthesized and found to be a monoprotic acid with a molar mass of 248 g/mol. When 0.0050 mol of this acid are dissolved in 0.500 L of water, the pH is measured as 3.89. What is the pKa of this acid?
A. 3.89
B. 7.78
C. 5.78
D. 2.33
Answer: C

A solution contains 2.00 mole of acetic acid, CH3COOH, and 1.00 mole of calcium acetate, Ca(CH3COO)2. The solution is able to resist the addition of a small amount of strong acid or strong base with only minor changes in the pH of the solution. Larger quantities of strong acid or strong base can cause a significant change in pH. How many moles of nitric acid, HNO3, may be added before the pH begins to change significantly?
A. 0.500 mole
B. 1.00 mole
C. 2.00 mole
D. 3.00 mole
Answer: C

An experiment was performed to determine the moles of carbon dioxide gas formed (collected over water) when an acid reacts with limestone. To do this, a piece of dry limestone was weighed. Then carbon dioxide was collected until the limestone disappeared. The atmospheric pressure was measured at 0.965 atm. The temperature was 295 K. The volume of CO2 was measured to the nearest mL and corrected for the vapor pressure of water. The student continuously got low results from what was expected. Can you suggest why?
A. Limestone is never pure CaCO3.
B. Limestone is Ca(HCO3)2.
C. Carbon dioxide is rather soluble in water.
D. Perhaps there was not enough acid to dissolve all the limestone.
